PART I 
Item 1. Business 
General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors, or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts worldwide. We also provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial). Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. 
On July 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the Opel/Vauxhall Business) to Peugeot, S.A. (PSA Group). On October 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the European financing subsidiaries and branches (the Fincos, and together with the Opel/Vauxhall Business, the European Business) to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. The European Business is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report relates to our continuing operations. 
Automotive Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI). GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC and Holden brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Jiefang and Wuling brands. 
In addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers, we also sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. 
Competitive Position and Vehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely. 
We present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors as well as sales to the U.S. Government, and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2018 36% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands): 
Years Ended December 31,

24.1% 
(a) 
Wholesale vehicle sales related to transactions with the European Business were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 

(b) 
Wholesale vehicle sales include 131 and 128 vehicles related to transactions with the European Business for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 


Total vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales, such as sales to large and small businesses, governments, and daily rental car companies; and (3) vehicles used by dealers in their businesses, including courtesy transportation vehicles. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue we

Contents 

recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by GM's dealers, distributors, and joint ventures, commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data, and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.

As discussed above, total vehicle sales and market share data provided in the table above includes fleet vehicles. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers. Prior to January 1, 2018 a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies were recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations. Beginning January 1, 2018, a significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as sales at the time of delivery to daily rental car companies. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands): 
Years Ended December 31, 
2018 2017 2016 

Product Pricing Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. 
Cyclical Nature of Business Retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends in part on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. 
Relationship with Dealers We market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. 
The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships: 
December 31, 2018  December 31, 2017  December 31, 2016  
GMNA  4,793  4,809  4,857  
GMI  7,716  7,641  8,598  

Total 

We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions. 
The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters. 
Research, Product and Business Development and Intellectual Property Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control, improved fuel economy, electrification, autonomous vehicles, the safety of drivers and passengers, and urban mobility. Research and development expenses were $7.8 billion, $7.3 billion and $6.6 billion in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Product Development The Product Development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and propulsion components to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Global teams in Design, Program Management, Component & Subsystem Engineering, Product Integrity, Safety, Propulsion Systems and Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale. 
Our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Cross-segment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our current vehicle portfolio, as we expect that more than 75% of our global sales volume will come from five vehicle architectures by early next decade. We will continue to leverage our current architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals. 
In November 2018 we announced plans to transform our product development and optimize our product portfolio. We are evolving our global product development workforce and processes to drive world-class levels of engineering in advanced technologies and to improve quality and speed to market. 
Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric Vehicles We are investing in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eAssist, plug-in hybrid, full hybrid, extended range and zero emission battery electric vehicles that are part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and GHG emissions. We currently offer seven 2018 model year vehicles in the U.S. featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Bolt EV. 
Car-and Ride-Sharing Maven is a shared vehicle marketplace that leverages a versatile software and operational platform to provide members with on-demand access to vehicles through two primary services, Maven Gig and Maven Car Sharing. Maven Gig allows members to access vehicles that can be used in ride-sharing and delivery with companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and GrubHub Inc. Maven Car Sharing is a consumer service that provides on-demand access to Maven owned and peer-owned vehicles through a new peer-to-peer car-sharing offering. Maven is available in 24 cities across the U.S., Canada and Australia. Through December 31, 2018 Maven Gig and Maven Car Sharing have accumulated in aggregate over 171 million miles driven, 34 million all-electric miles driven and 247,000 reservations. Maven now has 190,000 members. 
Autonomous Technology We see autonomous technology leading to a future of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, since more than 90% of crashes are caused by driver error, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We are among the leaders in the industry with significant global real-world experience in delivering connectivity and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features that are driving our leadership position in the development of autonomous technology. An example of advanced technology is Super Cruise, a driver assistance feature that enables hands-free driving on the highway, which will be expanded to all Cadillac models, with roll-out beginning in 2020. 
We are actively testing autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, California; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Michigan. Gated by safety and regulation, we continue to make rapid progress toward commercialization of a network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the U.S. 
In January 2018 we revealed the Cruise AV, a production-intent self-driving vehicle that was engineered from the start to operate safely on its own, with no driver. 
In May 2018 SoftBank Vision Fund (The Vision Fund) agreed to invest in GM Cruise, our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. In addition, in October 2018 we reached an agreement to work jointly with Honda Motor Co., Ltd (Honda) to fund and develop a shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) for GM Cruise that can serve a wide variety of use cases and be manufactured at high volume. For additional information on third-party investments in GM Cruise, refer to the Overview section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). 
Alternative Fuel Vehicles We believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting GHG emissions in the transportation sector. By leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on ethanol-gasoline blend fuels as well as technologies that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 
We offer a variety of FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the 2019 model year to retail and fleet customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. In Brazil, a substantial majority of vehicles sold are FlexFuel vehicles capable 
4 
Table

Contents 

of running on high ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in other global markets where biofuels are in the marketplace. We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources. 
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology Another part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and GHG emissions is our commitment to the development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, have accumulated more than three million miles of real-world driving. These programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology. We are exploring non-traditional automotive uses for fuel cells in several areas, including demonstrations with the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. 
We signed a co-development agreement and established a nonconsolidated JV with Honda in 2016 for a next-generation fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies, aiming for commercialization in the early 2020s. We expect the collaboration to succeed by sharing expertise, economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and building upon GM's and Honda's strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology. 
OnStar and Vehicle Connectivity OnStar, LLC (OnStar) provides subscription-based and complementary services to more than 20 million connected vehicles globally. OnStar provides connected safety, security and mobility solutions for retail and fleet customers, including automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, roadside assistance, dealer maintenance notifications, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle location services, hands-free calling, Smart Driver and Marketplace. OnStar also offers additional connectivity packages that include remote vehicle access through a mobile application, on-demand vehicle diagnostics, connected navigation and 4G LTE wireless connectivity. 
Intellectual Property We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents are individually material to our business as a whole, these patents are important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace. 
Raw Materials, Services and Supplies We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements. We continue to experience higher commodity costs and anticipate higher costs associated with tariffs. 
In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers have been approximately 12% of our total purchases in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks. 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters 
Automotive Emissions Control We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system and other in-use compliance monitoring activities may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall. Emission and OBD requirements have become more stringent as a result of lower emission standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world driven by policy priorities such as air quality, energy security and climate change, often with very little harmonization. While we believe all of our products are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements, regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers. This includes vehicle emissions testing, including CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions testing, and review of emission control designs and strategies. 
The U.S. federal government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards, as well as the requirement that increasing percentages of Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEVs) must be sold in California. The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt California emission standards in lieu of federal requirements. Thirteen states have adopted California emission standards, and ten 
5 
Table 
of 
Contents 

of these have adopted the ZEV requirements. There is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California emissions and ZEV requirements in the future. 
Although the EPA has not imposed ZEV requirements, the EPA and California's emissions control standards will likely increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. The Canadian federal government's vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the U.S. federal requirements. The Canadian province of Quebec has adopted ZEV requirements starting with the 2018 model year largely based on California program requirements. 
Each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavy-duty engines will meet emission requirements of the EPA before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and of the CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements. 
China implemented the China 5 emission standard nationwide at the beginning of 2017. China 5 is more stringent than the previous program on all levels including overall emission requirements and the time and mileage period for which vehicles need to meet China 5 level performance. China will implement a unique China 6 emission standard that combines elements of both European and U.S. standards and includes more stringent emission requirements and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation for new registrations is expected in July 2020 for China 6a and July 2023 for the more stringent China 6b standard. Localities can pull ahead China 6 requirements if certain criteria are met. The majority of cities that have announced plans to implement China 6 early have projected implementation in July 2019, but one city has indicated implementation in the three months ended March 31, 2019. For additional information, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
In South America certain countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and others follow the European Union test procedures, standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. Brazil implemented national L6 standards for light diesel vehicles in 2012 and OBD installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles were implemented in 2015 for all models. 
As a result of the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business, GM's vehicle presence in Europe is smaller, but GM may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to Opel/Vauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as well as to other vehicles GM continues to sell in Europe. In the European Union, increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards, including implementation of "real world driving" emissions tests, as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. For example, our former German subsidiary has participated in continuing discussions with German and European authorities concerning emissions control systems. For additional information, refer to Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. 
Automotive Fuel Economy In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) promulgates and enforces Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years, including credits obtained from other manufacturers. In addition to federal CAFE, the EPA promulgates and enforces GHG emission standards, which are effectively fuel economy standards because the majority of vehicle GHG emissions are carbon dioxide emissions that are emitted in direct proportion to the amount of fuel burned by a vehicle. The EPA and NHTSA also regulate the fuel efficiency and GHG emissions of medium-and heavy-duty vehicles, imposing more stringent standards over time. 
In Canada, light-duty and heavy-duty GHG regulations are currently patterned after the existing EPA GHG emission standards. However, with both the 
U.S. and Canadian governments reviewing potential changes to these existing regulations and the difference in each country's climate change policies, there is an increased risk that future Canadian light-duty GHG regulations may not be aligned with future EPA regulations. In addition, CARB has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards for motor vehicles, and other states have asserted the right to adopt the California standards. Until recently, CARB regulations have provided that compliance with the federal EPA light-duty GHG program is deemed to be in compliance with the California standards through the 2025 model year. However, on December 12, 2018 CARB amended this regulation to clarify that, in the event the EPA alters the GHG stringency by means of the now-pending EPA GHG rulemaking, compliance with the EPA's GHG emissions standards will no longer be deemed in compliance with CARB's requirements. As a result, depending on the outcome of the EPA GHG rulemaking and finality of CARB's regulatory amendment in the future GM might be required to meet California standards that are different than the EPA GHG standards.

China has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement. With a focus on the fleet average program, the current China Phase 4 fleet fuel consumption requirement, which went into effect in 2016, is based on curb weight with full compliance to 5.0L/100 km required by 2020. China Phase 4 has continued subsidies for plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China Phase 5 is currently being developed with a planned start in 2021 with full compliance to 4.0L/100km required by 2025. In addition, China has established the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Mandate which will require passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to generate "credits" equivalent to 10% in 2019 and 12% in 2020 against the internal combustion engine vehicle production volume. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency. The NEV Mandate requirement for 2021 to 2025 currently is being developed with a goal of NEV volume reaching 20% of total vehicle volume in 2025. 
Regulators in other jurisdictions have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulations. If regulators in these jurisdictions seek to impose and enforce emission standards that are misaligned with market conditions, we may be forced to take various actions to increase market support programs for more fuel-efficient vehicles and curtail production of certain high-performance cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in order to achieve compliance. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations. 
Industrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. 
To mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment, we are converting as many of our worldwide operations as practicable to landfill-free operations which reduces GHG emissions associated with waste disposal. At December 31, 2018, 75 (or approximately 50%) of our manufacturing operations and 61 of our non-manufacturing operations were landfill-free, including idled facilities. At our landfill-free manufacturing operations approximately 94% of waste materials are composted, reused, or recycled and approximately 5% are converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. In 2018 we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted 1.6 million metric tons of waste from landfill, resulting in approximately 6.9 million metric tons of GHG emissions avoided in global manufacturing operations, including construction, demolition and remediation wastes. 
In addition to minimizing our impact on the environment, our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production by-products, reduce our use of material, reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal. 
We continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy, improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables. We are committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewable energy by 2050. At December 31, 2018 we had implemented projects or signed renewable energy contracts globally that had increased our total renewable energy capacity to over 400 megawatts, which represents approximately 20% of our global electricity use. In 2018, several wind farms totaling approximately 250 megawatts now match the load of GM facilities in Texas, Ohio and Indiana. We continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind, solar, and landfill gas. In 2018 Energy Star certified one assembly plant in Canada through Natural Resources Canada and 17 buildings in the U.S. for superior energy management. We also met the EPA Energy Star Challenge for Industry (EPA Challenge) at eight additional sites globally by reducing energy intensity an average of 13% at these sites within 2.5 years. To meet the EPA Challenge, industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10% within a five year period. In total 75 GM-owned manufacturing sites have met the EPA Challenge, with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 137 recognitions. These efforts minimize our utility expenses and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a GHG emissions reduction target, collecting accurate data, following our business plan to operate more efficiently and publicly reporting progress against our target. 
Chemical Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry. 
Globally, governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Stockholm, Basel and Rotterdam

Contents 

Conventions on Chemicals and Waste and the Minamata Convention on Mercury, are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. In addition, more global jurisdictions are establishing substance standards with regard to Vehicle Interior Air Quality. 
Chemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S. the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, and several U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design such as the California and Washington laws banning the use of copper in brake friction material. Chemical restrictions in Canada continue to progress rapidly as a result of Environment Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic. 
China prohibits the use of several chemical substances in vehicles. There are also various regulations in China stipulating the requirements for chemical management. Among other things, these regulations catalogue and restrict the use and the import and export of various chemical substances. The failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt production in China or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the China market. 
These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. We believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates. 
Safety In the U.S. the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the U.S. that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. If we or NHTSA determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S. 
Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures, adding complexity to regulatory compliance. 
Automotive Financing -GM Financial GM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through joint ventures in China. 
GM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum. Additionally, GM Financial offers commercial lending products to dealers including new and used vehicle inventory floorplan financing and dealer loans, that are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, and to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Other commercial lending products include financing for parts and accessories, dealer fleets and storage centers. 
In North America, GM Financial offers a sub-prime lending program. The program is primarily offered to consumers with a FICO score or its equivalent of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending. 
GM Financial generally seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, through securitization transactions and through the issuance of unsecured debt in public markets.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
We have listed below the most significant risk factors applicable to us. These risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence: 
If we do not deliver new products, services and customer experiences in response to increased competition in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry. Industry participants are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies, products, services, and methods of travel and vehicle ownership. It is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry, including consumer adoption of electric vehicles and commercialization of autonomous vehicles in a rideshare environment. To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that are outside of our historically core business, such as autonomous and electric vehicles, digital services and transportation as a service. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is complex, costly, and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent. There can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. If we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed. 
Our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models preserving our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars and trucks is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. It generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles. 
Our profitability is dependent upon the success of SUVs and full-size pick-up trucks. While we offer a balanced portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, we generally recognize higher profit margins on our SUVs and trucks. Our success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. Any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles. 
We may continue to restructure our operations in the U.S. and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions, but we may not succeed in doing so. Since 2017, we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world, including the U.S., Korea and Europe. As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. For example, in late 2018, we announced certain transformation actions to drive significant cost efficiencies and realign our current 
10

manufacturing capacity and utilization in response to market-related volume declines in passenger cars. There is no guarantee that we will realize the anticipated savings or benefits from past or future restructuring and/or cost reduction actions in full or within the time periods we expect. In addition, these actions also subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, litigation, negative publicity and business disruption. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and/or cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. 
Our electric vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to reduce the cost of manufacturing electric vehicles, as well as increased consumer adoption. We anticipate that the production and profitable sale of electric vehicles will become increasingly important to our business. Our inability to reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of battery-electric vehicles may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition. We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development of electric vehicles. The benefits from these incentives could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted, which may negatively affect our ability to sell electric vehicles at high enough prices to be profitable. In addition, our sale of electric vehicles is dependent upon consumer adoption, which could be impacted by numerous factors, including perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost; perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge; high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; volatility in the cost of fuel; government regulations and economic incentives; and access to charging facilities. 
Our autonomous vehicle strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational, and regulatory risks. In recent years, we announced significant investments in autonomous vehicle technologies, including in GM Cruise Holdings LLC (GM Cruise Holdings), our subsidiary that is responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. Our autonomous vehicle operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies, including: our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware, such as LiDAR sensors and other components; access to sufficient capital, including with respect to additional Softbank funding that is subject to regulatory approval; risks related to the manufacture of purpose-built autonomous vehicles; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to autonomous vehicle technologies than we do. In addition, we face risks related to the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulations. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, government scrutiny and further regulation. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. 
Our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales, including real estate values, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment, availability of affordable financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence, political unrest and global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the Overview section of the MD&A. We cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty.

Our significant business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-traditional market participants, such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to infotainment and other new technologies. Increased competition, increased U.S.-China trade restrictions and weakening economic conditions in China, among other things, may result in price reductions, reduced sales, profitability, and margins, and challenges to gain or hold market share. In addition to increased competition, Chinese regulators have announced aggressive "green" policy initiatives and quotas for the sale of electric vehicles, which have challenging lead times. 
Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within China. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the Chinese market, at times with challenging lead times to implement such requirements. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China and reduce our profitability. In particular, the announced intention of several Chinese cities to implement new China 6 emissions regulations in July 2019 represents a risk for the sales of our Chinese joint ventures. 
A significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. Many of our operations, primarily in China and Korea, are carried out by joint ventures. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. In joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. The benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. In addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. As a result, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture. Moreover, a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance, internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive or other actions or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities. 
The international scale and footprint of our operations exposes us to additional risks. We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks including: (1) changes in government leadership; (2) changes in labor, tax and other laws, regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives; (3) political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials, services, components, systems and parts, or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives; (4) political instability or government controls over certain sectors; (5) political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between China and the U.S.; (6) more detailed inspections, new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported into or exported from the U.S.; 
(7) 
new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements, including changes to, withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements (for example, the North American Free Trade Agreement or its successor), or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products; (8) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, and interest rates; (9) economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate; (10) differing local product preferences and product requirements, including government certification requirements related to, among other things, fuel economy, vehicle emissions and safety; (11) impact of compliance with U.S. and other foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions; (12) liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws; (13) differing labor regulations, requirements and union relationships; (14) differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships; and 

(15) 
difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations.

Any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule. We assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others. Should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions or catastrophic weather events, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment. 
In 2019, our collective bargaining agreement with the United Automobile Workers will expire, and we will negotiate a new agreement. In addition, in late 2018 we announced certain restructuring actions, which included among other things, a reduction in our workforce and the unallocation of products to certain manufacturing facilities in North America. As a result, we may be subject to an increased risk of strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions and employees. 
Any disruption in our suppliers' operations could disrupt our production schedule. Our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our use of "just-in-time" manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, contractual or other disputes with suppliers, and supplier financial difficulties or solvency problems could disrupt our suppliers' operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our higher margin vehicles. If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely. 
High prices of raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices for raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, or non-ferrous metals, including aluminum, copper and plastic, may lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. Changes in trade policies and tariffs, fluctuations in supply and demand, and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for raw materials and other inputs. This could, in turn, negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs. 
We operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results. The global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds demand. Many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs. Many of our competitors have responded to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs of marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations. Our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness. 
Domestic manufacturers in lower cost countries, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low-cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. In addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. These actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results. 
Competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that GM's intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services. There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, although GM takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of GM proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will 
13

Contents 

completely deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology. We sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of enforcement of patents by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services. 
Security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles, owned or maintained by us, GM Financial, or third-party vendors or suppliers on our behalf, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information. We rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked products, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, proprietary business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, these systems and products may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and products. Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. We have experienced such events in the past and, although past events were immaterial, future events may occur and may be material. 
Portions of our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts, such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to design, manufacture and sell products and services, and interrupt other business processes. 
Security breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in GM and our products. Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window and door lock functions. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 
Our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing, and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of our customers, employees, or suppliers are subject to increasingly complex, restrictive, and punitive regulations in all key market regions. Under these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. In addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Because many of these laws are new, there is little clarity as to their interpretation, as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. For example, in Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation came into effect on May 25, 2018, and applies to all our ongoing operations in the EU. This regulation significantly increases the potential financial penalties for noncompliance, including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover. Similar regulations are coming into effect in Brazil, China, and California.

Our operations and products are subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations and policies that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. We are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio, particularly regulations relating to emissions and fuel economy standards. Meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging, especially when standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions. We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily out of concern for the environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact). These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. In addition, an evolving but un-harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue. Refer to the "Environmental and Regulatory Matters" section of Item 1. Business for further information on these requirements. We also expect that manufacturers will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally. 
We expect that to comply with current or even revised fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles, as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, however. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs. 
In the current uncertain regulatory framework, environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of safety, fuel economy or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items. Any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue. 
Many of our advanced technologies, including autonomous vehicles, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty. 
We could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation (both in the 
U.S. and elsewhere), stockholder litigation, labor litigation in various countries (including Korea and Brazil) and proceedings related to the Ignition Switch Recall. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, substantial fines, significant reputational harm, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. In addition, we may become obligated to issue additional shares (Adjustment Shares) of up to 30 million shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends, stock splits and other transactions) to the Motors Liquidation Company (MLC) GUC Trust (GUC Trust) under a provision of the Amended and Restated Master Sale and Purchase Agreement between us and General Motors Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against the GUC Trust, as estimated by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court), exceed $35.0 billion. The GUC Trust stated in public filings that allowed general unsecured claims were approximately $31.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. For a further discussion of these matters refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. 
The costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for free repairs. At present, the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like autonomous, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements, and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company's products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.

We currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs. 
We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and/or regulations in the countries in which we do business, the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws, and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate. For example, the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, may differ from the Company's previously recorded amounts, possibly materially, due to potential changes in the Tax Act (including with respect to the regulations promulgated thereunder) or changes to its interpretation. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
We rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers in North America, South America and Asia/Pacific. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers. 
The primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of financing, including credit facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currencies; and changes to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions. 
Further, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, GM Financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires that GM Financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on GM Financial's ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. 
Our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns. Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments. 
Our future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions. 
There are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.

Factors which affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-U.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds.

Item 2. Properties 
At December 31, 2018 we had over 100 locations in the U.S. (excluding our automotive financing operations and dealerships) which are primarily for manufacturing, assembly, distribution, warehousing, engineering and testing. We, our subsidiaries or associated companies in which we own an equity interest own most of these properties and/or lease a portion of these properties. Leased properties are primarily composed of warehouses and administration, engineering and sales offices. 
We have manufacturing, assembly, distribution, office or warehousing operations in 33 countries, including equity interests in associated companies which perform manufacturing, assembly or distribution operations. The major facilities outside the U.S., which are principally vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations, are located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand. 
In November 2018 we announced our plans to realign our manufacturing capacity in response to market-related volume declines in passenger cars. 
GM Financial owns or leases facilities for administration and regional credit centers. GM Financial has 39 facilities, of which 26 are located in the U.S. The major facilities outside the U.S. are located in Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. 
Non-GAAP Measures Unless otherwise indicated, our non-GAAP measures discussed in this MD&A are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations. Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; Core EBIT-adjusted; earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures. 
These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors. 
EBIT-adjusted EBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include but are not limited to impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. 
Core EBIT-adjusted Core EBIT-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our core consolidated operating results. Core EBIT-adjusted begins with EBIT-adjusted and excludes the EBIT-adjusted results of GM Cruise. Prior to the three months ended June 30, 2018 Core EBIT-adjusted excluded the EBIT-adjusted results of autonomous vehicle operations, including GM Cruise, Maven and our investment in Lyft, Inc. (Lyft). The measure was changed to align with segment reporting. All periods presented have been recast to reflect the changes. 
EPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less income (loss) from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances. 
ETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. 
ROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of capital leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average

automotive net income tax assets during the same period. Adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale. 
Adjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&A for additional information.

The adjustments primarily consist of employee separation charges and accelerated depreciation. 

(b) 
These adjustments were excluded because of a strategic decision to rationalize our core operations by exiting or significantly reducing our presence in various international markets to focus resources on opportunities expected to deliver higher returns. The adjustments primarily consist of employee separation charges, asset impairments and supplier claims in the year ended December 31, 2018, all in Korea. The adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily consists of asset impairments and other restructuring actions in India, South Africa and Venezuela.

Overview Our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform GM into the world's most valued automotive company. Our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility through our zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion vision while also strengthening the core of our business: earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous, data connectivity; growing our brands; making tough, strategic decisions about which markets and products in which we will invest and compete; building profitable adjacent businesses and targeting 10% core margins on an EBIT-adjusted basis. 
In addition to our EBIT-adjusted margin improvement goal, through 2018 we fully realized our financial targets of $6.5 billion in total annual operational and functional cost savings compared to 2014 costs. 
For the year ending December 31, 2019 we expect EPS-diluted of between $5.17 and $6.00 and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $6.50 and $7.00. The following table reconciles expected EPS-diluted under U.S. GAAP to expected EPS-diluted-adjusted and includes the future impact of the expected adjustment related to transformation activities: 
Year Ending December 31,2019 
Diluted earnings per common share  $ 5.17-6.00  
Adjustment - transformation activities  1.17-1.59  
Tax effect on adjustment(a)  (0.17-0.26)  

EPS-diluted-adjusted $ 6.50-7.00 
(a) The tax effect of the adjustment is determined based on the tax laws and valuation allowance status of the jurisdiction to which the adjustment relates. 
We face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emissions standards, foreign exchange volatility, rising materials prices, trade policy and political uncertainty. As a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital, as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges. We expect transformation activities to drive approximately $6.0 billion of annual cash savings by the end of 2020, resulting from reductions in Automotive and other cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements, as well as reduced capital expenditures. This target includes approximately $4.5 billion of cost savings, to be achieved through staffing, manufacturing and product initiatives. As we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These additional actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations.

GMNA Industry sales in North America were 21.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2018 representing a decrease of 0.1% compared to the corresponding period in 2017. U.S. industry sales were 17.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Our total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, totaled 3.0 million units for market share of 16.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018 representing a decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2017. We continue to lead the U.S. industry in market share. 
In November 2018 we announced plans to accelerate steps to improve our overall business performance including the reorganization of global product development staffs, the realignment of manufacturing capacity in response to market-related volume declines in passenger cars and a reduction of our salaried workforce. We recorded charges of $1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018 and expect to record additional charges of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in 2019. These charges are primarily considered special for EBIT-adjusted, EPS diluted-adjusted, and adjusted automotive free cash flow purposes. 
We estimate GMNA's breakeven point at the U.S. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 to 11.0 million units. We expect to sustain a strong EBIT-adjusted margin in 2019 on continued strength of the U.S. industry light vehicle sales, favorable vehicle mix and continued focus on overall cost savings partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities and tariffs, as well as pricing pressures. 
The UAW contract ratified in November 2015 expires in September 2019. For discussion of the risks related to a significant labor disruption at one of our facilities, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
GMI Industry sales in China were 26.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2018 representing a decrease of 6.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Our total vehicle sales in China were 3.6 million units for a market share of 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2017. We continue to see strength in sales of our Cadillac vehicles, and Chevrolet outperformed the passenger vehicle industry. Baojun and Wuling sales were impacted by the market slowdown in less developed cities and market shift away from mini commercial vehicles. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $2.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019 we expect industry sales to remain relatively flat with a continuation of pricing pressures, a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and new energy vehicles as well as a weaker Chinese Yuan against the U.S. Dollar, which will continue to put pressure on our operations in China. While we expect China equity income to be moderately down, we expect to sustain strong China equity income by focusing on improvements in vehicle mix, cost efficiencies, and downstream performance optimization. 
Outside of China, many markets across the segment continue to improve, resulting in industry sales of 26.7 million units, representing an increase of 5.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This increase was due primarily to increases in India and Brazil. Our total vehicle sales were 1.2 million units for a market share of 4.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2017. 
In February 2018 we announced the closure of a facility and other restructuring actions in Korea. We recorded charges of $1.1 billion consisting of $0.6 billion in non-cash asset impairments and other charges and $0.5 billion in employee separation charges in the year ended December 31, 2018. We incurred $0.8 billion in cash outflows resulting from these Korea restructuring actions for employee separations and statutory pension payments in the year ended December 31, 2018. The charges are considered special for EBIT-adjusted, EPS-diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow reporting purposes. Refer to Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for information related to these restructuring actions. 
In connection with these restructuring actions, the Korea Development Bank (KDB) purchased approximately $0.7 billion of GM Korea Company's (GM Korea) Class B Preferred Shares from GM Korea (GM Korea Preferred Shares) in 2018. In conjunction with the GM Korea Preferred Share issuance we agreed to provide GM Korea future funding, if needed, not to exceed $2.8 billion through December 31, 2027, inclusive of $2.0 billion of planned capital expenditures through 2027. The actions being taken to address GM Korea's financial and operational performance have and may continue to result in litigation, negative publicity, business disruption, and labor unrest. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
GM Cruise In June 2018 GM Cruise Holdings issued $0.9 billion of convertible preferred shares (GM Cruise Preferred Shares) to SoftBank Investments Holdings (UK) Limited (SoftBank). Immediately prior to the issuance of the GM Cruise Preferred Shares, we invested $1.1 billion in GM Cruise Holdings. When GM Cruise's autonomous vehicles are ready for commercial deployment, SoftBank is obligated to purchase additional GM Cruise Preferred Shares for $1.35 billion, subject to regulatory approval.

In October 2018 GM Cruise Holdings issued $0.75 billion of GM Cruise Holdings Class E Common Shares to Honda, representing 5.7% of the fully diluted equity of GM Cruise Holdings at closing. In addition, Honda agreed to contribute approximately $2.0 billion primarily in the form of a long-term annual fee to GM Cruise Holdings for certain rights to use GM Cruise Holdings' trade names and trademarks and the exclusive right to partner with GM Cruise Holdings to develop, deploy and maintain a foreign market. The remaining contribution or funding will come in the form of shared development costs for a SAV that Honda, General Motors Holdings LLC and GM Cruise Holdings will jointly develop for deployment onto GM Cruise's autonomous vehicle network. All proceeds are designated exclusively for working capital and general corporate purposes of GM Cruise. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Corporate Beginning in 2012 through January 25, 2019, we purchased an aggregate of 510 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $16.4 billion. 
The ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of U.S., federal, state and Canadian governments. In addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. Such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. Refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Takata Matters In May 2016 NHTSA issued an amended consent order requiring Takata to file defect information reports (DIRs) for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phased-stabilized ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. NHTSA concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture. 
Although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any unrecalled GM vehicles within scope of the Takata DIRs, in cooperation with NHTSA we have filed Preliminary DIRs covering certain of our GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. We have also filed petitions for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicles subject to those Preliminary DIRs. NHTSA has consolidated our petitions and will rule on them at the same time. 
While these petitions have been pending, we have provided NHTSA with the results of our long-term studies and the studies performed by third-party experts, all of which form the basis for our determination that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required. 
We believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and our inflator aging studies and field data support the belief that the vehicles' unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk. For example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. The inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. Also, these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed, such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass. 
Accordingly, no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the Preliminary DIRs and amended consent order. However, in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicles subject to current or future Takata DIRs under the amended consent order in the U.S., we estimate a reasonably possible impact to GM of approximately $1.2 billion. 
GM has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the U.S. to replace Takata inflators in those vehicles. There are significant differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the U.S. We continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. Additional recalls, if any, could be material to our results of operations and cash flows. We continue to monitor the international situation. 
Contingently Issuable Shares Under the Amended and Restated Master Sale and Purchase Agreement between us and MLC, GM may be obligated to issue Adjustment Shares of our common stock if allowed general unsecured claims against the GUC

Automotive Financing -GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. The expansion of GM Financial's leasing program results in increased exposure to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices in 2018 held at similar levels as compared to 2017. We expect a decrease of 4% to 5% in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to continued increases in the industry supply of used vehicles. The following table summarizes the residual value as well as the number of units included in GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands): 
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 
Residual Value Units Percentage Residual Value Units Percentage 
Cars $ 4,884 379 22.3% $ 5,701 450 27.2% Trucks 7,299 296 17.4% 7,173 285 17.3% Crossovers 15,057 917 53.8% 13,723 818 49.5% SUVs 4,160 111 6.5% 3,809 99 6.0% Total $ 31,400 1,703 100.0% $ 30,406 1,652 100.0% 
During 2018 GM Financial continued to expand its prime lending programs in North America. Accordingly, GM Financial's retail penetration in North America increased to approximately 47% in the year ended December 31, 2018 from approximately 37% in 2017, due primarily to further alignment with GM and greater dealer engagement. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North America increased to 72% in 2018 from 61% in 2017. In the year ended December 31, 2018 GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 71%, retail finance charge income of 22%, and commercial finance charge income of 4%. 
Consolidated Results We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost includes primarily: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other includes primarily foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information. We adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," as amended (ASU 2014-09) on a modified retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. The impacts of the new standard are reflected in this MD&A. Refer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements or additional information.

The most significant element of our Automotive and other cost of sales is material cost which makes up approximately two-thirds of the total amount. The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns. 
Factors which most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information on volume and mix. 
In the year ended December 31, 2018 unfavorable Cost was due primarily to: (1) increased raw material and freight costs related to carryover vehicles of $1.3 billion; (2) charges of $1.3 billion primarily related to employee separation charges and accelerated depreciation resulting from the transformation activities; (3) increased other costs of $1.2 billion primarily related to manufacturing, engineering and warranty; (4) increased material and freight costs of $1.2 billion related to vehicles launched within the last twelve

GMNA Total Net Sales and Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2018 Total net sales and revenue increased due primarily to: (1) favorable pricing for Majors of $1.9 billion, partially offset by unfavorable pricing for carryover vehicles of $0.5 billion, inclusive of new revenue standard impacts; (2) increased net wholesale volumes due to an increase in sales of crossover and fleet vehicles, partially offset by a decrease in sales of passenger cars, planned downtime for full-size trucks and a decrease in sales of mid-size trucks; and (3) favorable Other due to increased sales of parts and accessories; partially offset by (4) unfavorable mix due to fleet customer, trim and other mix. 
In the year ended December 31, 2017 Total net sales and revenue decreased due primarily to: (1) decreased net wholesale volumes associated with a decrease in Chevrolet passenger car sales and a decrease in off-lease rental car sales; partially offset by (2) favorable mix associated with a decrease in sales of Chevrolet passenger cars and decreased volumes of off-lease rental car sales; (3) favorable pricing for Majors of $1.4 billion, partially offset by unfavorable pricing for carryover vehicles of $0.8 billion; and (4) favorable Other due primarily to the foreign currency effect resulting from the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. 
GMNA EBIT-Adjusted The most significant factors which influence profitability are industry volume and market share. While not as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold. Trucks, crossovers and cars sold currently have a variable profit of approximately 180%, 50% and 20% of our GMNA portfolio on a weighted-average basis. 
In the year ended December 31, 2018 EBIT-adjusted decreased due primarily to: (1) unfavorable Cost due to increased vehicle content for Majors of $1.3 billion and increased raw material and freight costs of $1.1 billion, partially offset by favorable materials performance of $1.0 billion related to carryover vehicles; and (2) unfavorable mix due to an increase in sales of crossover vehicles, fleet customer mix, trim and other mix, partially offset by decreased sales of passenger cars; partially offset by (3) favorable pricing; and (4) increased net wholesale volumes. 
In the year ended December 31, 2017 EBIT-adjusted decreased due primarily to: (1) decreased net wholesale volumes; and (2) unfavorable Other due primarily to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Mexican Peso against the U.S.

GMI Total Net Sales and Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2018 Total net sales and revenue decreased due primarily to: (1) decreased wholesale volumes in Korea due to the closure of a facility, in Argentina primarily driven by lower industry volumes, and in Asia/Pacific due to the withdrawal from the Indian and South African markets in 2017, partially offset by an increase in Brazil primarily due to an increase in sales of the Chevrolet Onix, Tracker and Equinox; (2) unfavorable Other due primarily to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Brazilian Real and Argentine Peso against the 
U.S. Dollar; partially offset by (3) favorable pricing related to carryover vehicles in Argentina and Brazil. 
In the year ended December 31, 2017 Total net sales and revenue increased due primarily to: (1) favorable pricing related to carryover vehicles in Argentina and Brazil and in Egypt to mitigate the impact of the weakening Egyptian Pound against the U.S. Dollar; (2) favorable mix driven by the increased sales of Chevrolet Cruze in Brazil and Argentina; and (3) increased wholesale volumes associated with the Chevrolet Onix in Brazil and Argentina, partially offset by decreased wholesale volumes across multiple product lines in Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa; (4) flat Other due primarily to the foreign currency effect resulting from the strengthening of the Brazilian Real and Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar, offset by the depreciation of the Argentine Peso and Egyptian Pound against the U.S. Dollar and decreased parts and accessories sales in the Middle East.

We view the Chinese market as important to our global growth strategy and are employing a multi-brand strategy led by our Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. In the coming years we plan to leverage our global architectures to increase the number of product offerings under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands in China and continue to grow our business under the local Baojun and Wuling brands, with Baojun focusing its expansion in less developed cities and markets. We operate in the Chinese market through a number of joint ventures and maintaining strong relationships with our joint venture partners is an important part of our China growth strategy.

Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations and future debt issuances. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. Our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet; and (3) return available cash to shareholders. Our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of $8.0 billion to $9.0 billion in 2019 as well as payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the multi-district litigation and any other recall-related contingencies; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (4) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors; and (5) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our Board of Directors. 
Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors, some of which are outside of our control. 
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long-term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations such as our pension plans, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. In September 2018, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes to pre-fund $0.6 billion in certain mandatory contributions to our U.K. and Canada pension plans due in 2019 through 2021. 
Our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our Board of Directors, not less than once annually. Management reaffirmed and our Board of Directors approved the capital allocation program, which includes reinvesting in our business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate of 20% or greater, maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including an average automotive target cash balance of $18 billion, and returning available cash to shareholders. 
As part of our capital allocation program, our Board of Directors authorized programs to purchase $9.0 billion in aggregate of our common stock which were completed in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017. We announced in January 2017 that our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $5.0 billion of our common stock with no expiration date, subsequent to completing the remaining portion of the previously announced programs. We completed $1.6 billion of the $5.0 billion program through December 31, 2018, which included $0.1 billion purchased in the three months ended March 31, 2018 in conjunction with the sale of GM common stock by the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (New VEBA). From inception of the program in 2015 through January 25, 2019 we had purchased an aggregate of 302 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for $10.6 billion. 
Automotive Liquidity Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.

We manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. Approximately 90% of our cash and marketable securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2018. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed. 
Our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers. 
We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2017 the total size of our credit facilities was $14.5 billion, which consisted principally of our two primary revolving credit facilities. In April 2018 we amended and restated our two existing revolving credit facilities and entered into a third facility, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion. These facilities consist of a 364-day, $2.0 billion facility, a three-year, $4.0 billion facility and a five-year, $10.5 billion facility. The facilities are available to us as well as certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GM Financial. The three-year, $4.0 billion facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.1 billion. The five-year, $10.5 billion facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies. The 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allows for borrowing in U.S. Dollars only. We have allocated the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility for exclusive use by GM Financial. Total automotive available credit under the facility remained unchanged at $14.5 billion at December 31, 2018. In January 2019 we entered into a new three-year unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of $3.0 billion, reducing to $2.0 billion in July 2020. The facility will be used to fund costs related to the transformation activities announced in November 2018 and to provide additional financial flexibility. 
We did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. GM Financial did not have any borrowings against our credit facility designated for their exclusive use at December 31, 2018 or the remainder of our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.6 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, which consisted primarily of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
In May 2018 we entered into an agreement with KDB to fund capital expenditure requirements of GM Korea. In the year ended December 31, 2018 KDB purchased $0.7 billion of GM Korea Preferred Shares. Additionally we agreed to provide future funding to GM Korea if needed, not to exceed $2.8 billion through December 31, 2027, inclusive of $2.0 billion of planned capital expenditures through 2027. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details. 
In September 2018 we issued $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with an initial weighted average interest rate of 5.03% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2049. The notes are governed by the same indenture that was used in past issuances, which contains terms and covenants customary of these types of securities including limitations on the amount of certain secured debt we may incur. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes were used to repay $1.5 billion of debt in October 2018 upon maturity, pre-fund $0.6 billion in certain mandatory contributions for our U.K. and Canada pension plans due in 2019 through 2021, and for other general corporate purposes. 
GM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid a dividend of $0.4 billion on its common stock in October 2018. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on a number of factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

Automotive Financing - GM Financial Liquidity GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, including securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, the funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured debt facilities, operating expenses, and interest costs. In September 2018 GM Financial issued $0.5 billion of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. In September 2017 GM Financial issued $1.0 billion of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details. The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions): 
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 
Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.9 $ 4.3 Borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets 18.0 12.5 Borrowing capacity on committed unsecured lines of credit 0.3 0.1 Borrowing capacity on revolving credit facility, exclusive to GM Financial 2.0  
Total GM Financial available liquidity $ 25.2 $ 16.9 
In the year ended December 31, 2018 available liquidity increased due primarily to an increase in cash and additional capacity on new and renewed secured revolving credit facilities, resulting from the issuance of securitizations and unsecured debt. In addition, GM Financial added $2.0 billion in borrowing capacity on our 364-day credit facility as described in the Automotive Liquidity section of this MD&A. 
GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities of $16.5 billion with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility. Refer to the Automotive Liquidity section of this MD&A for additional details. We have a support agreement with GM Financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to GM Financial. This agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of GM Financial's outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at GM Financial. In addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure GM Financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities. 
Credit Facilities In the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. At December 31, 2018 secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $26.4 billion, $0.4 billion and $2.0 billion with advances outstanding of $3.4 billion, an insignificant amount and $2.0 billion.

In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to an increase in leased vehicle income and finance charge income, partially offset by increased interest expense. 
In the year ended December 31, 2018 Net cash used in investing activities decreased due primarily to: (1) increased collections on finance receivables of $4.5 billion; (2) increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of $4.2 billion; and (3) decreased purchases of leased vehicles of $2.4 billion; partially offset by (4) increased purchases and funding of finance receivables of $6.8 billion. 
In the year ended December 31, 2017 Net cash used in investing activities decreased due primarily to: (1) increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of $4.1 billion; (2) increased collections and recoveries on retail finance receivables of

$3.0 billion; and (3) decreased purchases of leased vehicles of $0.3 billion; partially offset by (4) increased net purchases of retail finance receivables of $5.5 billion. 
In the year ended December 31, 2018 Net cash provided by financing activities decreased due primarily to a decrease in borrowing, net of payments, of $4.6 billion and a decrease in the issuance of preferred stock of $0.5 billion. 
In the year ended December 31, 2017 Net cash provided by financing activities decreased due primarily to an increase in repayments of $12.4 billion and a special dividend payment to GM of $0.6 billion, partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $9.0 billion and the issuance of preferred stock of $1.0 billion. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize off-balance sheet securitization arrangements. All trade or finance receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Refer to Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements for detailed information related to guarantees we have provided and for our noncancelable operating lease obligations. 
Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities We have minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations. A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or fixed minimum price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. Based on these definitions, the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations. The majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities. The following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2018:

__________  

(a) 
Amounts include automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and capital lease obligations. Automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2018. 

(b) 
GM Financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2018 for floating rate debt and the contractual rates for fixed rate debt. GM Financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments. 

(c) 
Amounts include OPEB payments under the current U.S. contractual labor agreements through 2019 and Canada labor agreements through 2021. These agreements are generally renegotiated in the year of expiration. Amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. 

(d) 
Amounts do not include future cash payments for long-term purchase obligations and other accrued expenditures (unless specifically listed in the table above) which were recorded in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities at December 31, 2018. 

(e) 
Amounts include all expected future payments for both current and expected future service at December 31, 2018 for OPEB obligations for salaried and hourly employees extending beyond the current North American union contract agreements, workers' compensation and extended disability benefits. Amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.

The table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities, certified pre-owned, extended warranty and free maintenance of $8.5 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of $1.3 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows potentially associated with these amounts. In addition, future cash outflows related to transformation activities announced in November 2018 are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. To fund costs associated with transformation activities, we entered into a new three-year committed unsecured revolving credit facility in January 2019, with an initial borrowing capacity of $3.0 billion reducing to $2.0 billion in July 2020. 
Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates. 
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models. 
We accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable, which is generally at the time of sale. 
The estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall campaigns, the number of vehicles per recall campaign, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors. 
The estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the take rate, and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.2 billion. 
Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations. 
Sales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue. 
Valuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Leases Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms which typically range from two to five years. At the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. The expected residual value is based on third-party data which considers inputs including recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the 
38 
Table 
of 
Contents 

residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. Since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle prior to or at the end of the contract, we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. 
The following table summarizes vehicles included in GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands): 
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 
Cars 379 450 Trucks 296 285 Crossovers 917 818 SUVs 111 99 Total 1,703 1,652 
At December 31, 2018 the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was $31.4 billion. We periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates. If we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed, we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. The following table illustrates the effect of a 1% change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2018, which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant: 
Impact to DepreciationExpense 
Cars $ 49 Trucks 73 Crossovers 150 SUVs 42 
Total $ 314 
We also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make, year and model into leased asset groups, check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards. A leased asset group is considered impaired if impairment indicators exist and the undiscounted expected future cash flows (including the expected residual value) are lower than the carrying value of the asset group. We believe no impairment indicators existed during 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
Pension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. 
In December 2018 an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.6% at December 31, 2017 to 6.4% at December 31, 2018. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans. 
Another key assumption in determining net pension and OPEB expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount 
39 
Table

rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment. 
The Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2018. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and have updated our base mortality assumptions in the U.S. This change in assumption decreased the December 31, 2018 U.S. pension and OPEB plans' obligations by $0.3 billion. We determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our December 31, 2018 U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations. 
Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $4.7 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The year-over-year change is primarily due to lower than expected asset returns partially offset by the increase in discount rates. At December 31, 2018 $2.1 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (primarily 10% of the projected benefit obligation (PBO)) and subject to amortization. The weighted-average amortization period is approximately sixteen years resulting in amortization expense of $0.1 billion in 2019. 
The underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans decreased by $0.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.1 billion due primarily to: (1) a favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $4.1 billion; and (2) other favorable changes including contributions, demographic gains and assumption changes of $0.3 billion; partially offset by (3) service and interest cost of $2.3 billion; and (4) an unfavorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $1.4 billion. 
The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant: 
U.S. Plans(a) Non-U.S. Plans(a) 
Effect on Effect on Effect on 2019 December 31, 2018 Effect on 2019 December 31, 2018 Pension Expense PBO Pension Expense PBO 
25 basis point decrease in discount rate -$80 +$1,480 +$19 +$589 25 basis point increase in discount rate +$80 -$1,420 +$11 -$564 25 basis point decrease in expected rate of return on assets +$140 N/A +$33 N/A 25 basis point increase in expected rate of return on assets -$140 N/A -$33 N/A 
(a) The sensitivity does not include the effects of the individual annual yield curve rates applied for the calculation of the service and interest cost. 
Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions, investment strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category. 
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances. 
Forward-Looking Statements In this 2018 Form 10-K and in reports we subsequently file and have previously filed with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and file or furnish on Form 8-K, and in related comments by our management, we use words like "aim," "anticipate," "appears," "approximately," "believe," "continue," "could," "designed," "effect," "estimate," "evaluate," "expect," "forecast," "goal," "initiative," "intend," "may," "objective," "outlook," "plan," "potential," "priorities," "project," "pursue," "seek," "should," "target," "when," "will," "would," or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements that represent our current judgment about possible future events.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
The overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the Financial Risk Council which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council. Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures. 
Automotive The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. Sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk. The models used assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect 
41 
Table

Contents 

of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously. In addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures, offsetting long-short positions in currency or other exposures such as interest rates which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2018 our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Chinese Yuan, Australian Dollar, Mexican Peso, and Argentine Peso. Derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards, swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at December 31, 2018. 
The net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was $0.9 billion and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been $0.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. We had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of $2.7 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition. 
The following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses: 
Years Ended December 31, 
2018  2017  
Translation (gains) losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ 353  $  (275)  
Transaction and remeasurement losses recorded in earnings  $ 156  $  43  

Interest Rate Risk We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments, primarily debt, capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities. We did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair value liability of debt and capital leases was $13.5 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% decrease in quoted interest rates would have been $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
We had marketable securities of $6.0 billion and $8.3 billion classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 

Automotive Financing -GM Financial 
Interest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. Typically retail finance receivables purchased by GM Financial bear fixed interest rates and are funded by variable or fixed rate debt. Commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial bear variable interest rates and are funded by variable rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging strategies to lock in the interest rate spread. 
Fixed interest rate receivables purchased by GM Financial may be pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility, GM Financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities. 
42 
Table 
of 
Contents 

In GM Financial's securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that, in turn, sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors. Derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and caps, are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions. 
Quantitative Disclosure We measure the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve. However, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore, the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below. These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements. 
Under these interest rate scenarios, we are asset-sensitive, meaning that we expect more assets than liabilities to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on our assets will increase more than the interest paid on our debt, which would initially increase our net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, we would expect our net interest income to initially decrease. The following table presents our net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement: 
Years Ended December 31, 
2018 2017 
One hundred basis points instantaneous increase in interest rates $ 10.7 $ 19.4 
One hundred basis points instantaneous decrease in interest rates(a) $ (10.7) $ (19.4) 
(a) Net interest income sensitivity given a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent. 
Additional Model Assumptions The sensitivity analysis presented is our best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios; however, our actual results could differ. Our estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives. Our prepayment projections are based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors change, our actual prepayment experience could be different than projected. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk GM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's financial condition. 
GM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is used GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to minimize any impact to earnings. 
GM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $3.9 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant. 
The following table summarizes GM Financial's foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses: 
Years Ended December 31, 
2018  2017  
Translation (gains) losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss  $ 291  $  (474)  
Transaction and remeasurement losses, net recorded in earnings  $ 12  $  9

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 6, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in 2018 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," as amended. 

Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited General Motors Company and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2018, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows and Equity for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and our report dated February 6, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation 
General Motors Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts worldwide and are investing in and growing an autonomous ride-sharing vehicle business. We also provide automotive financing services through GM Financial. We analyze the results of our continuing operations through the following segments: GMNA, GMI, GM Cruise and GM Financial. GM Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. As a result of the growing importance of our autonomous vehicle operations, we moved these operations from Corporate to GM Cruise and began presenting GM Cruise as a new reportable segment in 2018. All periods presented have been recast to reflect the segment changes. Nonsegment operations and Maven, our ride-and car-sharing business, are classified as Corporate. Corporate includes certain centrally recorded income and costs such as interest, income taxes, corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment specific revenues and expenses. 
On July 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business to PSA Group. On October 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the Fincos to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. The European Business is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report relates to our continuing operations. Refer to Note 22 for additional information on our discontinued operations. 
In 2018 we changed the presentation of our consolidated statements of cash flows to separately classify Depreciation and impairment of Equipment on operating leases, net and Depreciation, amortization and impairment charges on Property, net. We have made corresponding reclassifications to the comparable information for all periods presented. 
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. 
We consolidate entities that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest and we consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are the primary beneficiary. Our share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in our consolidated operating results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate. Beginning January 1, 2018 we no longer use the cost method of accounting due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (ASU 2016-01). Refer to Note 2 for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards. 
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. 
GM Financial The amounts presented for GM Financial have been adjusted to include the effect of our tax attributes on GM Financial's deferred tax positions and provision for income taxes, which are not applicable to GM Financial on a stand-alone basis, and to eliminate the effect of transactions between GM Financial and the other members of the consolidated group. Accordingly, the amounts presented will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis. 
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies 
The accounting policies that follow are utilized by our automotive, automotive financing and GM Cruise operations, unless otherwise indicated. The information presented on Revenue Recognition, Equipment on Operating Leases, Marketable Debt Securities, Equity Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments reflects our recently adopted accounting standards on January 1, 2018. 
Revenue Recognition We adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, which requires us to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when we have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. We adopted ASU 2014-09 by applying the modified retrospective method to all noncompleted contracts as of the date of adoption. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards section for additional information pertaining to the adoption of ASU 2014-09. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The following accounting policies became effective upon the adoption of ASU 2014-09:

Automotive Automotive net sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for vehicle, parts and accessories and services and other sales. The consideration recognized represents the amount received, typically shortly after the sale to a customer, net of estimated dealer and customer sales incentives we reasonably expect to pay. Significant factors in determining our estimates of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time. A portion of the consideration received is deferred for separate performance obligations, such as maintenance and vehicle connectivity, that will be provided to our customers at a future date. Taxes assessed by various government entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, collected at the time of the vehicle sale are excluded from Automotive net sales and revenue. Costs for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the vehicle transfers to the dealer are recognized at the time of sale and presented in Automotive and other cost of sales. 
Vehicle, Parts and Accessories For the majority of vehicle and accessories sales our customers obtain control and we recognize revenue when the vehicle transfers to the dealer, which generally occurs when the vehicle is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a dealer. Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price. 
Certain transfers to daily rental companies are accounted for as sales, with revenue recognized at the time of transfer. Such transactions were previously accounted for as operating leases. At the time of transfer, we defer revenue for remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a deposit liability for amounts expected to be returned once the remarketing services are complete. Deferred revenue is recognized in earnings upon completion of the remarketing service. Transfers that occurred prior to January 1, 2018 and future transfers containing a substantive repurchase obligation continue to be accounted for as operating leases and rental income is recognized over the estimated term of the lease. Our total exposure to vehicle repurchase obligations would be reduced to the extent vehicles are able to be resold to a third party. 
Used Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles returned from daily rental car companies and vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales. 
Services and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-sale services such as maintenance, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of less than three years. 
Automotive Financing -GM Financial Finance charge income earned on receivables is recognized using the effective interest method. Fees and commissions (including incentive payments) received and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously charged off). 
Income from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs and incentives, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.

Advertising and Promotion Expenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $4.0 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Research and Development Expenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were $7.8 billion, $7.3 billion and $6.6 billion in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities. Cost sharing payments and fees related to these arrangements are presented in Automotive and other cost of sales. 
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We are required to post cash as collateral as part of certain agreements that we enter into as part of our operations. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Fair Value Measurements A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable. 
Marketable Debt Securities We classify marketable debt securities as either available-for-sale or trading. Various factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of related income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Trading debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. We determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method. 
We measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We conduct an annual review of our pricing service and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices. 
An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if unrealized losses related to non-trading investments in debt securities are other-than-temporary. Factors considered include the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and the intent to sell or likelihood to be forced to sell the debt security before any anticipated recovery. 
Accounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate of probable losses. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
GM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. GM Financial uses forecasting models to determine the collective allowance for loan losses based on factors including historical delinquency migration to loss, probability of default and loss given default. The loss confirmation period is a key assumption within the models and represents the average amount of time from when a loss event first occurs to when the receivable is charged off. GM Financial also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on various indicators.

Retail finance receivables that become classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are separately assessed for impairment. A specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivables discounted at the original weighted average effective interest rate. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs. 
Retail finance receivables are generally charged off in the month in which the account becomes 120 days contractually delinquent if GM Financial has not yet recorded a repossession charge-off. A repossession charge-off generally represents the difference between the estimated net sales proceeds and the unpaid balance of the contract, including accrued interest. 
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete. 
Equipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years and vehicle sales to rental car companies that are expected to be repurchased in an average of seven months. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease contracts and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. The estimate of the residual value is evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes. Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive operations when a vehicle that is accounted for as a lease is returned the asset is reclassified from Equipment on operating leases, net to Inventories at the lower of cost or estimated selling price, less costs to sell. Upon disposition, proceeds are recorded in Automotive net sales and revenue and costs are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. In our automotive finance operations when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or estimated selling price, less costs to sell. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for any difference between the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset. 
Equity Investments When events and circumstances warrant, equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than­temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. 
Property, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under capital leases is included in property, plant and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The amortization of the assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. 
Special Tools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.

Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 or when events occur or circumstances change that would trigger such a review. The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. 
Intangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property, customer relationships and dealer networks. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or an accelerated method of amortization over their estimated useful lives. An accelerated amortization method reflecting the pattern in which the asset will be consumed is utilized if that pattern can be reliably determined. We consider the period of expected cash flows and underlying data used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets when selecting a useful life. Amortization of developed technology and intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales. 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are considered held for use until disposition. 
Pension and OPEB Plans 
Attribution, Methods and Assumptions The cost of benefits provided by defined benefit pension plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of pension plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the duration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement specific to the plan, the expected future working lifetime or the life expectancy of the plan participants. 
The cost of medical, dental, legal service and life insurance benefits provided through postretirement benefit plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of postretirement plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the average period to full eligibility or the average life expectancy of the plan participants. 
An expected return on plan asset methodology is utilized to calculate future pension expense for certain significant funded benefit plans. A market-related value of plan assets methodology is also utilized that averages gains and losses on the plan assets over a period of years to determine future pension expense. The methodology recognizes 60% of the difference between the fair value of assets and the expected calculated value in the first year and 10% of that difference over each of the next four years. 
The discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates. In the U.S. we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. We apply individual annual yield curve rates to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and OPEB plans to more specifically link the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment. 
The benefit obligation for pension plans in Canada, the U.K. and Germany represents 92% of the non-U.S. pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2018. The discount rates for plans in Canada, the U.K. and Germany are determined using a cash flow matching approach similar to the U.S. 
Plan Asset Valuation Due to the lack of timely available market information for certain investments in the asset classes described below as well as the inherent uncertainty of valuation, reported fair values may differ from fair values that would have been used had timely available market information been available.

Common and Preferred Stock Common and preferred stock for which market prices are readily available at the measurement date are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are actively traded and are classified in Level 1. Such equity securities for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use of observable inputs, which may include the use of adjusted market prices last available, bids or last available sales prices and/or other observable inputs and are classified in Level 2. Common and preferred stock classified in Level 3 are privately issued securities or other issues that are valued via the use of valuation models using significant unobservable inputs that generally consider aged (stale) pricing, earnings multiples, discounted cash flows and/or other qualitative and quantitative factors. 
Debt Securities Valuations for debt securities are based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Debt securities priced via pricing services that utilize matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices, are classified in Level 2. Debt securities that are typically priced by dealers and pricing services via the use of proprietary pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are classified in Level 3. These inputs primarily consist of yield and credit spread assumptions, discount rates, prepayment curves, default assumptions and recovery rates. 
Investment Funds, Private Equity and Debt Investments and Real Estate Investments Investment funds, private equity and debt investments and real estate investments are valued based on the Net Asset Value (NAV) per Share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of readily available market prices. 
NAV's are provided by the respective investment sponsors or investment advisers and are subsequently reviewed and approved by management. In the event management concludes a reported NAV does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the financial reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance sheet date. In determining whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could affect the valuation, such as changes in the composition or performance of the underlying investments or comparable investments, overall market conditions, expected sale prices for private investments which are probable of being sold in the short-term and other economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation. 
Stock Incentive Plans Our stock incentive plans include RSUs, RSAs, PSUs, stock options and awards that may be settled in our stock, the stock of our subsidiaries or in cash. We measure and record compensation expense based on the fair value of GM or GM Cruise's common stock on the date of grant for RSUs, RSAs and PSUs and the grant date fair value, determined utilizing a lattice model or the Black-Scholes formula, for stock options and PSUs. RSUs granted in stock of GM Cruise vest upon satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition, defined as a change in control transaction or the consummation of an initial public offering. Compensation cost for awards that do not have an established accounting grant date, but for which the service inception date has been established, or are settled in cash is based on the fair value of GM or GM Cruise's common stock at the end of each reporting period. We record compensation cost for service-based RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and service-based stock options on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for retirement eligible employees over the requisite service period. Compensation costs for RSUs granted in stock of GM Cruise are recorded when the liquidity condition described above is met. We use the graded vesting method to record compensation cost for stock options with market conditions over the lesser of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. 
Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold and are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes in these factors. 
The estimated costs related to recall campaigns are accrued when probable and estimable, which is generally at the time of vehicle sale. In GMNA, we estimate the costs related to recall campaigns by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns, the number of vehicles per recall campaign, the estimated number of vehicles to be repaired and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign. The estimated costs associated with recall campaigns in other geographical regions are determined using the estimated costs of repairs and the estimated number of vehicles to be repaired. Costs associated with recall campaigns are charged to Automotive and other cost of sales. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors. 
Income Taxes The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred 
56

Contents 


GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws or rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law. 
Deferred income tax assets are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years. 
Income tax expense (benefit) for the year is allocated between continuing operations and other categories of income such as Other comprehensive income (loss). In periods in which there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and pre-tax income in another income category, the tax benefit allocated to continuing operations is determined by taking into account the pre-tax income of other categories. 
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not criteria, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense (benefit). 
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date and any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose local currency is not their functional currency are remeasured from their local currency to their functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar. 
Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements discussed in the preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses were $168 million, $52 million and $229 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of each derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as an accounting hedge, as well as the type of hedging relationship identified. Derivative instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 
Automotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risks. The change in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities. 
Certain foreign currency and commodity forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is the foreign currency and commodity price risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. 
We estimate the fair value of the PSA warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the PSA stock price and the estimated dividend yield. We are entitled to receive any dividends declared by PSA through the conversion date upon exercise of the warrants. Gains or losses as a result of the change in the fair value of the PSA warrants are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. 
Automotive Financing -GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
not designated as hedges is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities. 
Certain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. 
Certain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is the interest rate and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded currently in earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. 
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2014-09, as incorporated into Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, on a modified retrospective basis by recognizing a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings. Under ASU 2014­09 sales incentives are recorded at the time of sale rather than at the later of sale or announcement, thereby resulting in the shifting of incentive amounts to an earlier quarter and fixed fee license arrangements are recognized when access to intellectual property is granted instead of over the contract period. The retiming of quarterly incentive amounts mainly offset for the year ended December 31, 2018. Actual incentive spending is dependent upon future market conditions. 
Beginning January 1, 2018 certain transfers to daily rental companies are accounted for as sales when ownership of the vehicle is not expected to transfer back to us. Such transactions were previously accounted for as operating leases. Transfers that occurred prior to January 2018 continue to be accounted for as operating leases because at the original time of transfer an expectation existed that ownership of the vehicle would transfer back to us. 
The following table summarizes the financial statement line items within our consolidated income statement and balance sheet significantly impacted by ASU 2014-09:

ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in Net income. 
In the three months ended March 31, 2018 we adopted ASU 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities" (ASU 2017-12), on a modified retrospective basis and adopted ASU 2018-02, "Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" (ASU 2018-02), on a modified retrospective basis. ASU 2018-02 provides the option to reclassify stranded tax effects related to the Tax Act in accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The adjustment relates to the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate. The cumulative effect of the adjustments to the opening balance of Retained earnings for these adopted standards was $108 million. 
The following table summarizes the changes to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-01, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2018-02: 
Adjustment due to ASU Adjustment due to ASU 2016-01, ASU 2017-12 December 31, 2017 2014-09 and ASU 2018-02 January 1, 2018 
Deferred income taxes $ 23,544 $ 444 $ (63) $ 23,925 
Other assets $ 4,929 $ 195 $ 242 $ 5,366 
GM Financial short-term debt and current portion of long-term 
debt $ 24,450 $  $ (13) $ 24,437 
Accrued liabilities $ 25,996 $ 2,328 $  $ 28,324 
Other liabilities $ 12,394 $ (235) $  $ 12,159 
Retained earnings $ 17,627 $ (1,336) $ 290 $ 16,581 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (8,011) $  $ (98) $ (8,109) 
Effective January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Payments" (ASU 2016-15), which clarified guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and prior periods were not restated. 
Effective January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2017-07, "Compensation -Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost" (ASU 2017-07) on a retrospective basis, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and OPEB (income) expense be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs. The remaining components of net periodic pension and OPEB (income) expense are now presented outside operating income. Amounts previously reflected in Operating income were reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2017-07. Refer to Note 15 for amounts that were reclassified. 
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In February 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases" (ASU 2016­02), which requires us as the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of right of use assets and lease obligations for those leases currently classified as operating leases. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor remains largely unchanged. ASU 2016­02 became effective for us on January 1, 2019 and we elected the optional transition method as well as the package of practical expedients upon adoption. While we are still finalizing our adoption procedures, we estimate the primary impact to our consolidated financial position upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations for approximately $1.0 billion. 
In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" (ASU 2016-13), which requires entities to use a new impairment model based on Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) rather than incurred losses. We plan to adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, which will result in an increase to our allowance for credit losses and a decrease to Retained earnings as of the adoption date. Estimated credit losses under CECL will consider relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, resulting in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses upon loan origination. We are currently

evaluating new processes to calculate credit losses in accordance with ASU 2016-13 that, once completed, will determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Adjustments to sales incentives for previously recognized sales were insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Contract liabilities in our Automotive segments consist primarily of maintenance, extended warranty and other service contracts. We recognized revenue of $1.4 billion related to contract liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to recognize revenue of $1.5 billion, $509 million and $626 million in the years ending December 31, 2019, 2020 and thereafter related to contract liabilities as of December 31, 2018.

The allowance for loan losses on retail and commercial finance receivables included a collective allowance of $586 million, $611 million and $525 million and a specific allowance of $325 million, $331 million and $280 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Retail Finance Receivables We use proprietary scoring systems in the underwriting process that measure the credit quality of retail finance receivables using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores (e.g. FICO score or its equivalent) and contract characteristics. We also consider other factors such as employment history, financial stability and capacity to pay. Subsequent to origination we review the credit quality of retail finance receivables based on customer payment activity. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 25% and 33% of retail finance receivables were from consumers with sub-prime credit scores, which are defined as a FICO score or its equivalent of less than 620 at the time of loan origination. 
We purchase retail finance contracts from automobile dealers without recourse, and accordingly, the dealer has no liability to GM Financial if the consumer defaults on the contract. Finance receivables are collateralized by vehicle titles and GM Financial has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract.

Commercial Finance Receivables Our commercial finance receivables consist of dealer financings, primarily for inventory purchases. Proprietary models are used to assign a risk rating to each dealer. We perform periodic credit reviews of each dealership and adjust the dealership's risk rating, if necessary. Dealers in Group VI are subject to additional restrictions on funding, including suspension of lines of credit and liquidation of assets. The commercial finance receivables on non-accrual status were insignificant at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Nonconsolidated affiliates are entities in which an equity ownership interest is maintained and for which the equity method of accounting is used due to our ability to exert significant influence over decisions relating to their operating and financial affairs. Revenue and expenses of our joint ventures are not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of the earnings of each joint venture is reflected as Equity income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
Note 11. Variable Interest Entities 
GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered VIEs to issue variable funding notes to third party bank-sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIEs is backed by finance receivables and leasing related assets transferred to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and the variable interests in the VIEs give GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required and does not currently intend to provide additional financial support to these SPEs. While these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's consolidated financial statements, they are separate legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's creditors. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to GM Financial's consolidated VIEs: 
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 
Restricted cash - current $ 1,876 $ 1,740 Restricted cash - non-current $ 504 $ 527 GM Financial receivables, net of fees - current $ 18,304 $ 15,141 GM Financial receivables, net of fees - non-current $ 14,008 $ 12,944 GM Financial equipment on operating leases, net $ 21,781 $ 22,222 GM Financial short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt $ 21,087 $ 18,972 GM Financial long-term debt $ 21,417 $ 20,356 
GM Financial recognizes finance charge, leased vehicle and fee income on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the secured debt issued in a securitization transaction and records a provision for loan losses to recognize probable loan losses inherent in the finance receivables.

In April 2018 we amended and restated our two existing revolving credit facilities and entered into a third facility, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion. These facilities consist of a 364-day, $2.0 billion facility, a three-year, $4.0 billion facility and a five-year, $10.5 billion facility. The facilities are available to us as well as certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GM Financial. The three-year, $4.0 billion facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.1 billion. The five-year, $10.5 billion facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies. The 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allows for borrowing in U.S. Dollars only. We have allocated the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility for exclusive use by GM Financial. 
In September 2018 we issued $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with an initial weighted average interest rate of 5.03% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2049. The notes are governed by the same indenture that was used in past issuances, which contains terms and covenants customary of these types of securities including limitations on the amount of certain secured debt we may incur. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes were used to repay $1.5 billion of debt in October 2018 upon maturity, pre-fund $584 million in certain mandatory contributions for our U.K. and Canada pension plans due in 2019 through 2021, and for other general corporate purposes.

In January 2019 we entered into a new three-year committed unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of $3.0 billion, reducing to $2.0 billion in July 2020. The facility will be used to fund costs related to the transformation activities announced in November 2018 and to provide additional financial flexibility.

Secured debt consists of revolving credit facilities and securitization notes payable. Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged Securitized Assets. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on GM Financial's involvement with VIEs. GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 2.85% at December 31, 2018. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2024 and securitization notes payable have maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2026. At the end of the revolving period, if not renewed, the debt of revolving credit facilities will amortize over a defined period. In the year ended December 31, 2018 GM Financial entered into new or renewed credit facilities with a total net additional borrowing capacity of $695 million, which had substantially the same terms as existing debt and GM Financial issued $22.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of securitization notes payable with an initial weighted average interest rate of 3.00% and maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2026. 
Unsecured debt consists of senior notes, credit facilities and other unsecured debt. Senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2018 are due beginning in 2019 through 2028 and have a weighted-average interest rate of 3.40%. In the year ended December 31, 2018 GM Financial issued $8.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an initial weighted average interest rate of 3.36% and maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2028. 
In January 2019 GM Financial issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an initial weighted average interest rate of 5.03% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2029. 
In January 2019 GM Financial issued 850 million of Euro Medium Term Notes under the Euro Medium Term Note Programme with an interest rate of 2.20% due in 2024. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, GM Financial launched an unsecured commercial paper notes program in the U.S. At December 31, 2018, the principal amount outstanding of GM Financial's commercial paper in the U.S. was $1.2 billion. 
Each of the revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing GM Financial's notes contain terms and covenants including limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens. 
The terms of advances on credit facilities and other unsecured debt have original maturities of up to four years. The weighted-average interest rate on credit facilities and other unsecured debt was 5.98% at December 31, 2018.

(a) Secured debt, credit facilities and other unsecured debt are based on expected payoff date. Senior notes principal amounts are based on maturity. 
At December 31, 2018 future interest payments on automotive capital lease obligations were $565 million. GM Financial had no capital lease obligations at December 31, 2018. 
Compliance with Debt Covenants Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders, including providing certain subsidiary financial statements. Certain of GM Financial's secured debt agreements also contain various covenants, including maintaining portfolio performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels. GM Financial's unsecured debt obligations contain covenants including limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens. Failure to meet certain of these requirements may result in a covenant violation or an event of default depending on the terms of the agreement. An event of default may allow lenders to declare amounts outstanding under these agreements immediately due and payable, to enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements or restrict our ability or GM Financial's ability to obtain additional borrowings. No technical defaults or covenant violations existed at December 31, 2018.

Note 15. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits 
Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans Defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. hourly employees (hired prior to October 2007) and Canadian hourly employees (hired prior to October 2016) generally provide benefits of negotiated, stated amounts for each year of service and supplemental benefits for employees who retire with 30 years of service before normal retirement age. The benefits provided by the defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. (hired prior to January 1, 2001) and Canadian salaried employees and employees in certain other non-U.S. locations are generally based on years of service and compensation history. Accrual of defined pension benefits ceased in 2012 for U.S. and Canadian salaried employees. There is also an unfunded nonqualified pension plan covering primarily U.S. executives for service prior to January 1, 2007 and it is based on an "excess plan" for service after that date.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
The funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable laws and regulations or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate. In the year ended December 31, 2018 all legal funding requirements were met and we contributed $584 million to pre-fund U.K. and Canada pension plans. In the year ended December 31, 2016 we made a discretionary contribution to our U.S. hourly pension plan of $2.0 billion. The following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans: 
Years Ended December 31, 
2018  2017  2016  
U.S. hourly and salaried  $ 76  $ 77  $ 2,054  
Non-U.S.  1,624  1,153  1,022  
Total  $ 1,700  $ 1,230  $ 3,076  

We expect to contribute approximately $70 million to our U.S. non-qualified plans and approximately $600 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2019. 
Based on our current assumptions, over the next five years we expect no significant mandatory contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plans and mandatory contributions totaling $310 million to our U.K. and Canada pension plans. 
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Certain hourly and salaried defined benefit plans provide postretirement medical, dental, legal service and life insurance to eligible U.S. and Canadian retirees and their eligible dependents. Certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans, although most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored or administered programs. We made contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans of $325 million, $323 million and $335 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Plan participants' contributions were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Defined Contribution Plans We have defined contribution plans for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees that provide discretionary matching contributions. Contributions are also made to certain non-U.S. defined contribution plans. We made contributions to our defined contribution plans of $617 million, $650 million and $589 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Significant Plan Amendments, Benefit Modifications and Related Events 
Other Remeasurements The SOA issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2018. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and have updated our base mortality assumptions in the U.S. This change in assumption decreased the December 31, 2018 U.S. pension and OPEB plans' obligations by $264 million. We determined our current mortality improvement assumptions are appropriate to measure our December 31, 2018 
U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations. We incorporated the mortality improvement tables issued by the SOA in the three months ended December 31, 2016 that lowered life expectancies and thereby indicated the amount of estimated aggregate benefit payments to our U.S. pension plans' participants was decreasing. This change in assumption decreased the December 31, 2016 U.S. pension and OPEB plans' obligations by $888 million.

U.S. pension plan service cost includes administrative expenses and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation premiums which were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net expense are determined at the beginning of the period and updated for remeasurements. Non-U.S. pension plan administrative expenses included in service cost were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Estimated amounts to be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost in the year ending December 31, 2019 based on December 31, 2018 plan measurements are $129 million, consisting primarily of amortization of the net actuarial loss in the non-U.S. pension plans. 

Assumptions 
Investment Strategies and Long-Term Rate of Return Detailed periodic studies are conducted by our internal asset management group as well as outside actuaries and are used to determine the long-term strategic mix among asset classes, risk mitigation strategies and the expected long-term return on asset assumptions for the U.S. pension plans. The U.S. study includes a review of alternative asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies, anticipated future long­term performance and risk of the individual asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. Similar studies are performed for the significant non-U.S. pension plans with the assistance of outside actuaries and asset managers. While the studies incorporate data from recent plan performance and historical returns, the expected long-term return on plan asset assumptions are determined based on long-term prospective rates of return. 
We continue to pursue various options to fund and de-risk our pension plans, including continued changes to the pension asset portfolio mix to reduce funded status volatility. The strategic asset mix and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored specifically for each plan. Individual plans have distinct liabilities, liquidity needs and regulatory requirements. Consequently there are different investment policies set by individual plan fiduciaries. Although investment policies and risk mitigation strategies may differ among plans, each investment strategy is considered to be appropriate in the context of the specific factors affecting each plan. 
In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset mixes will effectively fund the projected pension plan liabilities, while aligning with the risk tolerance of the plans' fiduciaries. The strategic asset mixes for U.S. defined benefit pension plans are increasingly designed to satisfy the competing objectives of improving funded positions

(market value of assets equal to or greater than the present value of the liabilities) and mitigating the possibility of a deterioration in funded status. 
Derivatives may be used to provide cost effective solutions for rebalancing investment portfolios, increasing or decreasing exposure to various asset classes and for mitigating risks, primarily interest rate, equity and currency risks. Equity and fixed income managers are permitted to utilize derivatives as efficient substitutes for traditional securities. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan's targeted investment policy and equity derivatives may be used to protect equity positions from downside market losses. Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage, including through the use of derivatives, which may alter economic exposure. 
In December 2018 an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.6% at December 31, 2017 to 6.4% at December 31, 2018. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.

Investment Fund Strategies Investment funds include hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, equity funds and fixed income funds. Hedge funds and funds of hedge funds managers typically seek to achieve their objectives by allocating capital across a broad array of funds and/or investment managers. Equity funds invest in U.S. common and preferred stocks as well as similar equity securities issued by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in developed and/or emerging market countries. Fixed income funds include investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. High quality fixed income funds invest in government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage and asset-backed securities. High yield fixed income funds invest in high yield fixed income securities issued by corporations which are rated below investment grade. Other investment funds also included in this category primarily represent multi-strategy funds that invest in broadly diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and derivative instruments. 
Private equity and debt investments primarily consist of investments in private equity and debt funds. These investments provide exposure to and benefit from long-term equity investments in private companies, including leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and distressed debt strategies.

Real estate investments include funds that invest in entities which are primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development, financing, sale and/or management of income-producing real estate properties, both commercial and residential. These funds typically seek long-term growth of capital and current income that is above average relative to public equity funds. 
Significant Concentrations of Risk The assets of the pension plans include certain investment funds, private equity and debt investments and real estate investments. Investment managers may be unable to quickly sell or redeem some or all of these investments at an amount close or equal to fair value in order to meet a plan's liquidity requirements or to respond to specific events such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty. 
Illiquid investments held by the plans are generally long-term investments that complement the long-term nature of pension obligations and are not used to fund benefit payments when currently due. Plan management monitors liquidity risk on an ongoing basis and has procedures in place that are designed to maintain flexibility in addressing plan-specific, broader industry and market liquidity events. 
The pension plans may invest in financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and may be exposed to risks that the foreign currency exchange rates might change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of the foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Forward currency contracts may be used to manage and mitigate foreign currency risk. 
The pension plans may invest in debt securities for which any change in the relevant interest rates for particular securities might result in an investment manager being unable to secure similar returns upon the maturity or the sale of securities. In addition changes to prevailing interest rates or changes in expectations of future interest rates might result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the securities held. Interest rate swaps and other financial derivative instruments may be used to manage interest rate risk. 
Benefit Payments Benefits for most U.S. pension plans and certain non-U.S. pension plans are paid out of plan assets rather than our Cash and cash equivalents. The following table summarizes net benefit payments expected to be paid in the future, which include assumptions related to estimated future employee service:

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies  

Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters In the normal course of our business, we are named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation. We identify below the material individual proceedings and investigations where we believe a material loss is reasonably possible or probable. We accrue for matters when we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had accruals of $1.3 billion and $930 million in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. In many matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss. Accordingly adverse outcomes from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period. 
Proceedings Related to Ignition Switch Recall and Other Recalls In 2014 we announced various recalls relating to safety and other matters. Those recalls included recalls to repair ignition switches that could under certain circumstances unintentionally move from the "run" position to the "accessory" or "off" position with a corresponding loss of power, which could in turn prevent airbags from deploying in the event of a crash.

Economic-Loss Claims We are aware of over 100 putative class actions pending against GM in U.S. and Canadian courts alleging that consumers who purchased or leased vehicles manufactured by GM or MLC (formerly known as General Motors Corporation) had been economically harmed by one or more of the 2014 recalls and/or the underlying vehicle conditions associated with those recalls (economic-loss cases). In general, these economic-loss cases seek recovery for purported compensatory damages, such as alleged benefit-of-the-bargain damages or damages related to alleged diminution in value of the vehicles, as well as punitive damages, injunctive relief and other relief. 
Many of the pending U.S. economic-loss claims have been transferred to, and consolidated in, a single federal court, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District). These plaintiffs have asserted economic-loss claims under federal and state laws, including claims relating to recalled vehicles manufactured by GM and claims asserting successor liability relating to certain recalled vehicles manufactured by MLC. The Southern District has dismissed various of these claims, including claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, claims for recovery for alleged reduction in the value of plaintiffs' vehicles due to damage to GM's reputation and brand as a result of the ignition switch matter, and claims of certain plaintiffs who purchased a vehicle before GM came into existence in July 2009. The Southern District also dismissed certain state law claims at issue. 
In August 2017 the Southern District granted our motion to dismiss the successor liability claims of plaintiffs in seven of the sixteen states at issue on the motion and called for additional briefing to decide whether plaintiffs' claims can proceed in the other nine states. In December 2017 the Southern District granted GM's motion and dismissed successor liability claims of plaintiffs in an additional state, but found that there are genuine issues of material fact that prevent summary judgment for GM in eight other states. In January 2018, GM moved for reconsideration of certain portions of the Southern District's December 2017 summary judgment ruling. That motion was granted in April 2018, dismissing plaintiffs' successor liability claims in any state where New York law applies. 
In September 2018 the Southern District granted our motion to dismiss claims for lost personal time (in 41 out of 47 jurisdictions) and certain unjust enrichment claims, but denied our motion to dismiss plaintiffs' economic loss claims in 27 jurisdictions under the "manifest defect" rule. Significant summary judgment, class certification, and expert evidentiary motions remain at issue. 
Personal Injury Claims We also are aware of several hundred actions pending in various courts in the U.S. and Canada alleging injury or death as a result of defects that may be the subject of the 2014 recalls (personal injury cases). In general, these cases seek recovery for purported compensatory damages, punitive damages and/or other relief. Since 2016, several bellwether trials of personal injury cases have taken place in the Southern District and in a Texas state court, which is administering a Texas state multi-district litigation. None of these trials resulted in a finding of liability against GM. 
Appellate Litigation Regarding Successor Liability Ignition Switch Claims In 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the 2009 order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the sale of substantially all of the assets of MLC to GM free and clear of, among other things, claims asserting successor liability for obligations owed by MLC (successor liability claims) could not be enforced to bar claims against GM asserted by either plaintiffs who purchased used vehicles after the sale or against purchasers who asserted claims relating to the ignition switch defect, including pre-sale personal injury claims and economic-loss claims. 
Contingently Issuable Shares Under the Amended and Restated Master Sale and Purchase Agreement between us and MLC, GM may be obligated to issue Adjustment Shares of our common stock if allowed general unsecured claims against the GUC Trust, as estimated by the Bankruptcy Court, exceed $35.0 billion. The maximum number of Adjustment Shares issuable is 30 million shares (subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends, stock splits and other transactions), which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion based on the GM share price as of January 25, 2019. The GUC Trust stated in public filings that allowed general unsecured claims were approximately $31.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. In 2016 and 2017 certain personal injury and economic loss plaintiffs filed motions in the Bankruptcy Court seeking authority to file late claims against the GUC Trust. In May 2018, the GUC Trust filed motions seeking the Bankruptcy Court's approval of a proposed settlement with certain personal injury and economic loss plaintiffs, approval of a notice relating to that proposed settlement and estimation of alleged personal injury and economic loss late claims for the purpose of obtaining an order requiring GM to issue the maximum number of Adjustment Shares. GM vigorously contested each of these motions. 
In September 2018 the Bankruptcy Court denied without prejudice the GUC Trust's motions described above, finding that the settling parties first need to obtain class certification with respect to the economic loss late claims. In February 2019 the GUC Trust and certain plaintiffs filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court requesting approval of a new settlement to obtain the maximum

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
number of Adjustment Shares. We will assert available and appropriate legal objections to this new settlement. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter. 
Government Matters In connection with the 2014 recalls, we have from time to time received subpoenas and other requests for information related to investigations by agencies or other representatives of U.S. federal, state and the Canadian governments. GM is cooperating with all reasonable pending requests for information. Any existing governmental matters or investigations could in the future result in the imposition of damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. 
The total amount accrued for the 2014 recalls at December 31, 2018 reflects amounts for a combination of settled but unpaid matters, and for the remaining unsettled investigations, claims and/or lawsuits relating to the ignition switch recalls and other related recalls to the extent that such matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The amounts accrued for those unsettled investigations, claims, and/or lawsuits represent a combination of our best single point estimates where determinable and, where no such single point estimate is determinable, our estimate of the low end of the range of probable loss with regard to such matters, if that is determinable. We will continue to consider resolution of pending matters involving ignition switch recalls and other recalls where it makes sense to do so. 
GM Korea Wage Litigation GM Korea is party to litigation with current and former hourly employees in the appellate court and Incheon District Court in Incheon, Korea. The group actions, which in the aggregate involve more than 10,000 employees, allege that GM Korea failed to include bonuses and certain allowances in its calculation of Ordinary Wages due under Korean regulations. In 2012 the Seoul High Court (an intermediate level appellate court) affirmed a decision in one of these group actions involving five GM Korea employees which was contrary to GM Korea's position. GM Korea appealed to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea (Supreme Court). In 2014 the Supreme Court largely agreed with GM's legal arguments and remanded the case to the Seoul High Court for consideration consistent with earlier Supreme Court precedent holding that while fixed bonuses should be included in the calculation of Ordinary Wages, claims for retroactive application of this rule would be barred under certain circumstances. In 2015, on reconsideration, the Seoul High Court held in GM Korea's favor, after which the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not yet rendered a decision. We estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be approximately $590 million at December 31, 2018. Both the scope of claims asserted and GM Korea's assessment of any or all of the individual claim elements may change if new information becomes available or the legal or regulatory framework change. 
GM Korea is also party to litigation with current and former salaried employees over allegations relating to ordinary wages regulation and whether to include fixed bonuses in the calculation of ordinary wages. In 2017, the Seoul High Court held that certain workers are not barred from filing retroactive wage claims. GM Korea appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not yet rendered a decision. We estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be approximately $170 million at December 31, 2018. Both the scope of claims asserted and GM Korea's assessment of any or all of the individual claim elements may change if new information becomes available or the legal or regulatory framework change. 
GM Korea is also party to litigation with current and former subcontract workers over allegations that they are entitled to the same wages and benefits provided to full-time employees, and to be hired as full-time employees. In May 2018 the Korean labor authorities issued an adverse administrative order finding that GM Korea must hire certain current subcontract workers as full-time employees. GM Korea appealed that order. At December 31, 2018, we recorded an insignificant accrual covering certain asserted claims and claims that we believe are probable of assertion and for which liability is probable. We estimate that the reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for other current subcontract workers who may assert similar claims to be approximately $150 million at December 31, 2018. We are currently unable to estimate any possible loss or range of loss that may result from additional claims that may be asserted by former subcontract workers. 
GM Brazil Indirect Tax Claim In March 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil issued a decision concluding that a certain state value added tax should not be included in the calculation of federal gross receipts taxes. The decision reduced GM Brazil's gross receipts tax prospectively and, potentially, retrospectively. The retrospective right to recover is under judicial review, and a decision could be rendered in 2019. If the Judicial Court grants retrospective recovery we estimate potential recoveries of up to $1.3 billion. However, given the remaining uncertainty regarding the judicial resolution of this matter, we are unable to assess the likelihood of any favorable outcome at this time. We have not recorded any amounts relating to the retrospective nature of this matter. 
Other Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters Various other legal actions, including class actions, governmental investigations, claims and proceedings are pending against us or our related companies or joint ventures, including matters arising out of alleged product defects; employment-related matters; product and workplace safety, vehicle emissions and 
80

fuel economy regulations; product warranties; financial services; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships; government regulations relating to competition issues; tax-related matters not subject to the provision of ASC 740, Income Taxes (indirect tax-related matters); product design, manufacture and performance; consumer protection laws; and environmental protection laws, including laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental remediation from stationary sources. 
There are several putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. and in the Provincial Courts in Canada alleging that various vehicles sold including model year 2011-2016 Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra vehicles, violate federal and state emission standards. GM has also faced a series of additional lawsuits based primarily on allegations in the Duramax suit, including putative shareholder class actions claiming violations of federal securities law and a shareholder demand lawsuit. The securities lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed. At this stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss. 
We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that the resolution of one or more of these matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our results of operations. We also from time to time receive subpoenas and other inquiries or requests for information from agencies or other representatives of U.S. federal, state and foreign governments on a variety of issues. 
Indirect tax-related matters are being litigated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales, property taxes and other non-income tax related tax exposures. The various non-U.S. labor-related matters include claims from current and former employees related to alleged unpaid wage, benefit, severance and other compensation matters. Certain administrative proceedings are indirect tax-related and may require that we deposit funds in escrow or provide an alternative form of security which may range from $200 million to $550 million at December 31, 2018. Some of the matters may involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2018. We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For indirect tax-related matters we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be up to approximately $900 million at December 31, 2018. 
Takata Matters In May 2016 NHTSA issued an amended consent order requiring Takata to file DIRs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phased-stabilized ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. NHTSA concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture. 
Although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any unrecalled GM vehicles within scope of the Takata DIRs, in cooperation with NHTSA we have filed Preliminary DIRs covering certain of our GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. We have also filed petitions for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicles subject to those Preliminary DIRs. NHTSA has consolidated our petitions and will rule on them at the same time. 
While these petitions have been pending, we have provided NHTSA with the results of our long-term studies and the studies performed by third-party experts, all of which form the basis for our determination that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required. 
We believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and our inflator aging studies and field data support the belief that the vehicles' unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk. For example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. The inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. Also, these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed, such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass. 
Accordingly, no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the Preliminary DIRs and amended consent order. However, in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicles subject to current or future Takata DIRs under the amended consent order in the U.S., we estimate a reasonably possible impact to GM of approximately $1.2 billion.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
GM has recalled certain vehicles sold outside of the U.S. to replace Takata inflators in those vehicles. There are significant differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the U.S. We continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. Additional recalls, if any, could be material to our results of operations and cash flows. We continue to monitor the international situation. 
Through January 25, 2019 we are aware of three putative class actions pending against GM in federal court in the U.S., one putative class action in Mexico and three putative class actions pending in various Provincial Courts in Canada arising out of allegations that airbag inflators manufactured by Takata are defective. At this early stage of these proceedings, we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss. 
Product Liability With respect to product liability claims (other than claims relating to the ignition switch recalls discussed above) involving our and General Motors Corporation products, we believe that any judgment against us for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage. We recorded liabilities of $531 million and $595 million in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the expected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured. It is reasonably possible that our accruals for product liability claims may increase in future periods in material amounts, although we cannot estimate a reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information. 
Guarantees We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain joint ventures. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2019 to 2029 or upon the occurrence of specific events or are ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on vehicles sold to date was $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion for these guarantees at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the majority of which relate to the indemnification agreements. 
We provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances certain assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental car companies. 
We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these obligations. Insignificant amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insignificant. Refer to Note 22 for additional information on our indemnification obligations to PSA Group under the Agreement. 
Credit Cards Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 our redemption liability was insignificant, our deferred revenue was $247 million and $283 million, and qualified cardholders had rebates available, net of deferred program revenue, of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. Our redemption liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. 
Noncancelable Operating Leases The following table summarizes our minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases having initial terms in 
excess of one year, primarily for property:  
2019 Minimum commitments(a) $ 296 Sublease income (61) Net minimum commitments $ 235  2020 $ 286 (51) $ 235  2021 $ 247 (44) $ 203  2022 $ 180 (38) $ 142  2023 $ 146 (33) $ 113  Thereafter $ 582 (129) $ 453  Total $ 1,737 (356) $ 1,381  
__________ (a) Certain leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options.  

Rental expense under operating leases was $300 million, $284 million and $270 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 reflect the effect of temporary differences between amounts of assets, liabilities and equity for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets, liabilities and equity as measured based on tax laws, as well as tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. The following table summarizes the components of temporary differences and 
carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities:  
December 31, 2018  December 31, 2017  
Deferred tax assets  
Postretirement benefits other than pensions  $ 1,584  $ 1,948  
Pension and other employee benefit plans  3,020  3,285

Intangible assets  729  735  
Total deferred tax liabilities  1,827  1,153  
Net deferred tax assets  $ 23,302  $ 22,856  
_________  
(a)  At December 31, 2018 U.S. operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $8.6 billion expire through 2038 if not utilized.  

(b) At December 31, 2018 Non-U.S. operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $1.2 billion expire through 2037 if not utilized and the remaining balance of $5.2 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. 
Valuation Allowances We have $3.3 billion of net operating loss carryforwards in Germany that, as a result of reorganizations that took place in 2008 and 2009 and then existing German Law, were not previously recorded as deferred tax assets. In the three months ended December 31, 2018 a favorable European court decision was statutorily approved in Germany enabling use of those loss carryforwards. As a result, in the three months ended December 31, 2018 deferred tax assets totaling $1.0 billion were established for the loss carryfowards; offsetting valuation allowances were also established as the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized. During the year ended December 31, 2018 valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of $8.0 billion were comprised of cumulative losses, credits and other timing differences, primarily in Germany, Spain and South Korea. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017 there was a $2.3 billion increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets that are no longer realizable as a result of the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as described in Note 22. At December 31, 2017 valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of $6.7 billion were comprised of cumulative losses, credits and other timing differences, primarily in Germany, Spain and South Korea.

Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes activity of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: 
Years Ended December 31, 
2018 2017 2016 
Balance at beginning of period $ 1,557 $ 1,182 $ 1,337 
Additions to current year tax positions 292 160 49 
Additions to prior years' tax positions 264 448 96 
Reductions to prior years' tax positions (244) (195) (192) 
Reductions in tax positions due to lapse of statutory limitations (38) (44) (103) 
Settlements (450) (11) (1) 
Other (40) 17 (4) 
Balance at end of period $ 1,341 $ 1,557 $ 1,182 
At December 31, 2018 and 2017 there were $991 million and $390 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect our effective tax rate in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 income tax related interest and penalties were insignificant. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 we had liabilities of $116 million and $152 million for income tax related interest and penalties. 
At December 31, 2018 it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. 
Other Matters Income tax returns are filed in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have open tax years from 2008 to 2018 with various significant tax jurisdictions. Tax authorities may have the ability to review and adjust net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that were generated prior to these periods if utilized in an open tax year. These open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given audit cycle. 
The Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act changed many aspects of U.S. corporate income taxation and included reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementation of a territorial tax system and imposition of a tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We recognized the tax effects of the Tax Act in the year ended December 31, 2017 and recorded $7.3 billion in tax expense. The tax expense relates primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate. We applied the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act in 2017 and throughout 2018. At December 31, 2018, we have now completed our accounting for all the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. We reduced our year ended December 31, 2017 estimated tax expense of $7.3 billion to $7.1 billion, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate. 
The Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A Topic 740, No. 5 "Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income," states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. We have elected to account for GILTI as a current period expense when incurred.

Note 18. Restructuring and Other Initiatives 
We have and continue to execute various restructuring and other initiatives and we may execute additional initiatives in the future, if necessary, to streamline manufacturing capacity and other costs to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these programs involve voluntary separations, a liability is generally recorded at the time offers to employees are accepted. To the extent these programs provide separation benefits in accordance with pre-existing agreements, a liability is recorded once the amount is probable and reasonably estimable. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a liability is generally recorded at the communication date. Related charges are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense. The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to restructuring and other initiatives, including postemployment benefit reserves and charges: 
Years Ended December 31, 
2018 2017 2016 
Balance at beginning of period $ 227 $ 268 $ 383 
Additions, interest accretion and other 1,637 330 412 
Payments (600) (315) (490) 
Revisions to estimates and effect of foreign currency (142) (56) (37) 
Balance at end of period $ 1,122 $ 227 $ 268 
In the year ended December 31, 2018 restructuring and other initiatives in GMNA primarily included actions related to the unallocation of products to certain manufacturing facilities in 2019 and other employee separation programs. We recorded charges of $1.2 billion in GMNA in the year ended December 31, 2018 consisting of $941 million in employee separation and other charges, which are reflected in the table above, and $301 million primarily in non-cash accelerated depreciation, not reflected in the table above. We expect to incur additional restructuring and other charges in 2019 that range between $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, primarily related to accelerated depreciation, supplier-related charges, and employee-related separation charges. We expect cash outflows related to these activities of approximately $1.5 billion by the end of 2020. 
In the year ended December 31, 2018 restructuring and other initiatives in GMI primarily included the closure of a facility and other restructuring actions in Korea and employee separation programs. We recorded charges of $1.0 billion related to Korea, net of noncontrolling interests. These charges consisted of $537 million in non-cash asset impairments and other charges, not reflected in the table above, and $495 million in employee separation charges, which are reflected in the table above. We incurred $775 million in cash outflows resulting from Korea restructuring actions, primarily for employee separations and statutory pension payments. In GMI we expect to incur between $200 million and $300 million in additional employee separation and other charges in 2019, and we expect cash outflows related to previously announced restructuring activities of approximately $300 million in 2019. 
In the year ended December 31, 2017 restructuring and other initiatives primarily included restructuring actions announced in the three months ended June 30, 2017 in GMI. These actions related primarily to the withdrawal of Chevrolet from the Indian and South African markets at the end of 2017 and the transition of our South Africa manufacturing operations to Isuzu Motors. We continue to manufacture vehicles in India for sale to certain export markets. We recorded charges of $460 million in GMI primarily consisting of $297 million of asset impairments, sales incentives, inventory provisions and other charges, not reflected in the table above, and $163 million of dealer restructurings, employee separations and other contract cancellation costs, which are reflected in the table above. We completed these programs in GMI in 2017. Other GMI restructuring programs reflected in the table above include separation and other programs in Australia, Korea and India and the withdrawal of the Chevrolet brand from Europe. Collectively, these programs had a total cost of $892 million since inception in 2013 through the completion of the programs in the year ended December 31, 2017. 
In the year ended December 31, 2016 restructuring and other initiatives related primarily to charges of $240 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 in GMNA related to the cash severance incentive program to qualified U.S. hourly employees under our 2015 labor agreement with the UAW and insignificant costs for separation and other programs in Australia, Korea and India and the withdrawal of Chevrolet brand from Europe.

GM Cruise Preferred Shares On May 31, 2018, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with The Vision Fund. The Vision Fund subsequently assigned its rights and obligations under the Purchase Agreement to SoftBank. In June 2018, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, GM Cruise Holdings, our subsidiary, issued $900 million of GM Cruise Preferred Shares to SoftBank, representing 10.9% of GM Cruise Holdings' equity at closing. Immediately prior to the issuance of the GM Cruise Preferred Shares, we invested $1.1 billion in GM Cruise Holdings. When GM Cruise's autonomous vehicles are ready for commercial deployment, SoftBank is obligated to purchase additional GM Cruise Preferred Shares for $1.35 billion, subject to regulatory approval, after which the GM Cruise Preferred Shares will represent 18.6% of GM Cruise Holdings' equity. All proceeds are designated exclusively for working capital and general corporate purposes of GM Cruise. Dividends are cumulative and accrue at an annual rate of 7% and are payable quarterly in cash or in-kind, at GM Cruise's discretion. The GM Cruise Preferred Shares are also entitled to participate in GM Cruise dividends above a defined threshold. Prior to an initial public offering, SoftBank is restricted from transferring the GM Cruise Preferred Shares until June 28, 2025.

Beginning on June 28, 2025, we can call all, but not less than all of the GM Cruise Preferred Shares held by SoftBank at an amount equal to the greater of the original investment amount plus accrued distributions paid in-kind and the fair value of GM Cruise Holdings at the time of conversion. The GM Cruise Preferred Shares are classified as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. 
GM Cruise Common Shares In October 2018, GM Cruise Holdings entered into a Purchase Agreement with Honda, pursuant to which Honda invested $750 million in GM Cruise Holdings in exchange for Class E Common Shares, representing 5.7% of the fully diluted equity of GM Cruise Holdings at closing. In addition, Honda agreed to contribute approximately $2.0 billion primarily in the form of a long-term annual fee to GM Cruise Holdings for certain rights to use GM Cruise Holdings' trade names and trademarks and the exclusive right to partner with GM Cruise Holdings to develop, deploy, and maintain a foreign market. The remaining contribution or funding will come in the form of shared development costs for a SAV that Honda, General Motors Holdings LLC and GM Cruise Holdings will jointly develop for deployment onto GM Cruise's autonomous vehicle network. All proceeds are designated exclusively for working capital and general corporate purposes of GM Cruise. At the later of October 3, 2025 or the termination of the commercial agreements between GM Cruise Holdings and Honda, GM Cruise Holdings can call all, but not less than all of the Class E Common Shares at an amount equal to the then fair value of GM Cruise Holdings. The Class E Common Shares are classified as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. 
GM Korea Preferred Shares In the year ended December 31, 2018 KDB purchased $720 million of GM Korea Preferred Shares. Dividends on the GM Korea Preferred Shares are cumulative and accrue at an annual rate of 1%.

Note 22. Discontinued Operations 
On March 5, 2017 we entered into the Master Agreement to sell our European Business to PSA Group. On July 31, 2017 we closed the sale of our Opel/Vauxhall Business to PSA Group and on October 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the Fincos to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. The net consideration paid at closing for the European Business was $2.5 billion, consisting of (1) $2.2 billion in cash; and (2) $808 million in warrants in PSA Group; partially offset by (3) a $455 million de-risking premium payment made to PSA Group for assuming certain underfunded pension liabilities. The warrants are not exercisable for five years from closing. 
The total charge from the sale of the European Business during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $6.2 billion, net of tax, of which $3.9 billion was recorded in Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, and $2.3 billion was recorded in Income tax expense. The charge related to: (1) $4.3 billion of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable or that transferred to PSA Group; (2) $1.5 billion related to previously deferred pension losses and payment of the de-risking premium to PSA Group for its assumption of certain underfunded pension liabilities; (3) a pre-tax disposal loss of $525 million as a result of the sale of the Fincos, which included the recognition of $197 million of foreign currency translation losses; (4) a pre-tax charge of $421 million for the cancellation of production programs resulting from the convergence of vehicle platforms between our European Business and PSA Group; and (5) other insignificant costs to support the separation of operations provided for a period of time following closing; partially offset by proceeds.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
We retained net underfunded pension liabilities of $6.8 billion owed primarily to current pensioners and former employees of the European Business with vested pension rights. PSA Group assumed, pursuant to the Agreement, approximately $3.1 billion of net underfunded pension liabilities primarily with respect to active employees of the Opel/Vauxhall Business, and during the year ended December 31, 2017 our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller) made payments to PSA Group, or one or more pension funding vehicles, of $3.4 billion in respect of these assumed liabilities, which included pension funding payments for active employees and the de-risking premium payment of $455 million discussed above. 
The Seller agreed to indemnify PSA Group for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities including certain emissions and product liabilities. The Company entered into a guarantee for the benefit of PSA Group and pursuant to which the Company agreed to guarantee the Seller's obligation to indemnify PSA Group. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments. 
Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. In Germany, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) issued an order in October 2018 converting Opel's existing voluntary recall of certain vehicles into a mandatory recall for allegedly failing to comply with certain emissions regulations. In addition, at the KBA's request, the German authorities recently re­opened a separate criminal investigation that had previously been closed with no action. Opel is challenging the mandatory recall order of the KBA in court on the grounds that the emission control systems contained in the subject vehicles, have at all times complied with the regulations in place when the vehicles were manufactured, tested, approved and sold. 
Opel voluntarily recalled and serviced many of these vehicles between 2017 and 2018 at its own expense, and this expense should not be transferred to the Seller because it was undertaken voluntarily by Opel and accounted for at the time of the sale. However, the Seller may be obligated to indemnify PSA Group for certain additional expenses resulting from any mandatory recall that is actually implemented, including potential litigation costs, settlements, judgments and potential fines. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter. 
We continue to purchase from and supply to PSA Group certain vehicles for a period of time following closing. Total net sales and revenue of $1.9 billion and $853 million and purchases and expenses of $1.4 billion and $218 million related to transactions with the Opel/Vauxhall Business were included in continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Cash payments of $1.8 billion and $242 million and cash receipts of $2.3 billion and $1.2 billion were recorded in Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities -continuing operations related to transactions with the Opel/Vauxhall Business during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Note 23. Stock Incentive Plans 
GM Stock Incentive Awards 
We grant to certain employees RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and stock options (collectively, stock incentive awards) under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and prior to the 2017 LTIP, under our 2014 LTIP. The 2017 LTIP was approved by stockholders in June 2017 and replaced the 2014 LTIP. Shares awarded under the plans are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plans such as retirement, death or disability. 
RSU awards granted either cliff vest or ratably vest generally over a three-year service period, as defined in the terms of each award. PSU awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period, based on performance criteria determined by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of award. The number of shares earned may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met, surpassed or not met. Stock options expire 10 years from the grant date. Our performance-based stock options vest ratably over 55 months based on the performance of our common stock relative to that of a specified peer group. Our service-based stock options vest ratably over 19 months to three years. 
In connection with our acquisition of Cruise Automation, Inc. in May 2016, RSAs and PSUs in common shares of GM were granted to employees of GM Cruise Holdings. The RSAs vest ratably, generally over a three-year service period. The PSUs are contingent upon achievement of specific technology and commercialization milestones.

(a)  Includes the target amount of PSUs.  

Our weighted-average assumptions used to value our stock options are a dividend yield of 3.69% and 4.43%, expected volatility of 28.0% and 25.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 2.73% and 1.97%, and an expected option life of 5.98 and 5.84 years for options issued during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. There were no stock options issued during the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Total compensation expense related to the above awards was $316 million, $585 million and $627 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
At December 31, 2018 the total unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested equity awards granted was $208 million. This expense is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years. The total fair value of stock incentive awards vested was $317 million, $421 million and $325 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
GM Cruise Stock Incentive Awards 
In addition to the awards noted above, stock options and RSUs were granted to GM Cruise employees in common shares of GM Cruise Holdings in the year ended December 31, 2018. These awards were granted under the 2018 Employee Incentive Plan approved by GM Cruise Holdings' Board of Directors in August 2018. Shares awarded under the plan are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plan. There were no awards granted in GM Cruise common shares for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Stock options vest ratably over four to 10 years, as defined in the terms of each award. Stock options expire 10 years from the grant date. RSU awards granted vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition. The service condition for the majority of these awards is

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
satisfied over four years. The liquidity condition is satisfied upon the earlier of the date of a change in control transaction or the consummation of an initial public offering. 
Total compensation expense related to GM Cruise Holdings' share-based awards was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, no share-based compensation expense had been recognized for the RSUs because the liquidity condition described above was not met. Total unrecognized compensation expense for GM Cruise Holdings' nonvested equity awards granted was $392 million at December 31, 2018, which included the RSUs for which the liquidity condition had not been met. The expense related to stock options is expected to be recorded over a weighted-average period of 8.5 years. The timing of the expense related to RSUs will depend upon the date of the satisfaction of the liquidity condition.

operations, net of tax, and $2.3 billion is related to Income tax expense. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $7.3 billion tax expense related to the U.S. tax reform legislation. 
Note 25. Segment Reporting 
We report segment information consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating results and performance of the Company. As a result of the growing importance of our autonomous vehicle operations, we moved these operations from Corporate to GM Cruise and began presenting GM Cruise as a new reportable segment in the year ended December 31, 2018. Our GMNA, GMI and GM Financial segments were not significantly impacted. All periods presented have been recast to reflect the changes. 
We analyze the results of our business through the following segments: GMNA, GMI, GM Cruise and GM Financial. As discussed in Note 1, the European Business is presented as discontinued operations and is excluded from our segment results for all periods presented. The European Business was previously reported as our GM Europe (GME) segment and part of GM Financial. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and GM Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision maker evaluates GM Financial through earnings before income taxes-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract customers to dealer showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards meeting required fuel efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis. 
Substantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. 
GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Holden brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Jiefang and Wuling brands. GM Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology, and includes autonomous vehicle-related engineering and other costs. 
Our automotive operations' interest income and interest expense, Maven, legacy costs from the Opel/Vauxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment specific revenues and expenses are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, our investment in Lyft, PSA warrants, Maven vehicles and intercompany balances. Retained net underfunded pension liabilities related to the European Business are also recorded in Corporate. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2018. Based on this evaluation required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018. 
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
Our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2018, utilizing the criteria discussed in the "Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2018. Based on management's assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2018. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Beginning in 2019, we are enhancing our close, consolidation, planning and reporting processes through the implementation of a suite of new systems and system architectures. This new suite of systems will allow for increased agility, efficiency, and integration of data across the organization. We are using a phased implementation approach in which the first phase, implemented as of January 1, 2019, impacts our forecast and planning processes, inclusive of our year-over-year operating result changes discussed in the MD&A. The second phase, planned for implementation later in 2019, will impact our close, consolidation, financial reporting processes and related internal controls. For additional information refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Item 9B. Other Information 
As was previously announced by GM on November 29, 2018, effective January 1, 2019, Dan Ammann transitioned from President of GM to Chief Executive Officer of GM Cruise Holdings. 
While Mr. Ammann is an employee of GM Cruise Holdings, all awards granted under GM's 2014 LTIP and 2017 LTIP (the Plans) will continue to vest per the terms of the award agreements. In the event of Mr. Ammann's involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than "Cause" (as defined in the Plans), following such transfer, all awards shall continue to vest under the normal conditions as outlined in the award agreements. For any other termination other than disability, death or full career status, all awards will be forfeited per the terms of the Plans. Also, other than an award for service in 2018 as President of GM, while Mr. Ammann is an employee of GM Cruise Holdings, he will not receive an annual award under the 2017 Short-Term Incentive Plan, GM's annual cash incentive plan, the terms of which have been previously disclosed and filed by GM. He will receive a base salary at a level consistent with his seniority and scope of responsibility as CEO of GM Cruise Holdings. 
On February 4, 2019, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (Cruise Board) of GM Cruise Holdings granted RSUs for 16,914 GM Cruise Common Shares and stock options for 101,485 GM Cruise Common Shares to Dan Ammann under the GM Cruise Holdings 2018 Employee Incentive Plan. 
Vesting of the RSUs is conditioned on satisfaction of a time and service-based requirement (Time-Vesting Condition) and a liquidity event requirement (Performance-Vesting Condition). The Time-Vesting Condition will be satisfied with respect to: (1) 10.0% of the GM Cruise Common Shares on January 15, 2020; (2) 2.5% of the GM Cruise Common Shares on the 15th day of each calendar quarter thereafter; and (3) the final 5.0% vesting on October 15, 2028, provided Mr. Ammann remains a service provider of GM Cruise Holdings on each applicable vesting date. The Time-Vesting Condition will be satisfied as to 100% of the RSUs if the fair market value of the GM Cruise Common Shares meets a certain threshold, as determined by the Cruise Board. The Performance-Vesting Condition will be satisfied upon the earlier to occur of a change in control of GM Cruise Holdings and consummation of an initial public offering of GM Cruise Holdings. The RSUs will not vest unless a change of control or initial public offering occurs before the 10th anniversary of the date of grant of the RSUs. In the event of Mr. Ammann's involuntary termination for reasons other than "Cause" (as defined in his RSU award agreement), the RSUs shall be subject to accelerated vesting in the amount of RSUs that would have become vested had Mr. Ammann remained employed by GM Cruise Holdings for an additional 12 months following the date of termination. 
The stock options will vest and become exercisable with respect to: (1) 10.0% of the aggregate GM Cruise Common Shares on January 15, 2020; (2) 2.5% of the aggregate GM Cruise Common Shares on the 15th day of each calendar quarter thereafter; and (3) the final 5.0% vesting on October 15, 2028, provided Mr. Ammann remains a service provider of GM Cruise Holdings on each applicable vesting date. In the event Mr. Ammann's involuntary termination for reasons other than "Cause" (as defined in his stock options award agreement), Mr. Ammann shall be eligible to receive the following: (1) continued payment of his base salary for 12 months following the date of termination; and (2) the stock options shall accelerate and become eligible for immediate exercisability in an amount equal to the number of stock options that would have vested had Mr. Ammann remained employed by GM Cruise Holdings for an additional 12 months following the date of termination. 
The RSUs and stock options are subject to the following restrictive covenants: (1) nonsolicitation and noninterference with business relationships; (2) nonsolicitation and noninterference with covered persons; (3) false statements of fact; and (4) confidential information. The RSUs and stock options are also subject to the other terms and conditions of the Employee Incentive Plan. 
The foregoing description of the RSUs and the stock options does not purport to be complete and is subject, and qualified in its entirety by reference, to the award agreements and Employee Incentive Plan filed herewith as Exhibits 10.20 -10.22.

Section 6.4 Indemnification Procedures. In the event that indemnification, compensation or reimbursement may be sought under this Article VI (an "Indemnification Claim") in connection with (a) any action, suit or proceeding that may be instituted or 
(b) any claim that may be asserted, in each case by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Party seeking indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly give written notice of the assertion of such Indemnification Claim (which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the relevant Indemnification Claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof) to the Party from whom indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period set forth in Section 6.1; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification, compensation or reimbursement obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option, to be represented by counsel of its choice (the cost of which will be borne solely by the Indemnifying Party), which must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and to take sole control and defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with a Third Party Claim and, if the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, it shall notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so within thirty (30) days (or sooner if the nature of such Third Party Claim so requires) of the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim (the "Dispute Period"), subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.5; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if (x) such Third Party Claim relates to or arises from any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, or otherwise involves as the counter-party any Governmental Authority, or (y) such Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than monetary damages against the Indemnified Party that, in each case of (x) and (y), the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, based on the advice of its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of such Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages. If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to, or within the Dispute Period elects not to, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VI. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) the employment of such counsel has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) outside counsel to the Indemnified Party advises the Indemnified Party that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable; provided further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay 
23 
for more than one (1) such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any single Indemnification Claim. The Parties agree to cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment (each, a "Settlement") unless (1) the claimant provides to the Indemnified Party an unqualified release from all Liability (without any admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party) in respect of the relevant Third Party Claim and (2) such Settlement does not impose any liabilities or obligations on the Indemnified Party (other than monetary damages) and (B) the Indemnified Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), shall not settle any Third Party Claim. 
Section 6.5 Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations and Warranties. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement to the contrary:

(b) 
(i) Buyer shall not have any indemnification, compensation or reimbursement obligations for Losses under Section 6.3 arising as a result of (A) a breach of the Buyer Non-Fundamental Reps or (B) a breach of or failure to perform any of Buyer's covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, with respect to any individual claim (or series of related claims) unless such claims (or series of claims) involves Losses in excess of $250,000 (nor shall such item be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the Basket); (ii) Buyer shall not have any indemnification, compensation and reimbursement obligations for Losses under Section 6.3(a) arising as a result of a breach of the Buyer Non-Fundamental Reps unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses, finally determined, exceeds the Basket; provided, however, that from and after such time as the total amount of such Losses exceeds the Basket, then Buyer shall be liable only for the portion that exceeds the Basket, (iii) in no event shall the aggregate indemnification, compensation and reimbursement to be paid by Buyer for all Losses under Section 6.3(a) arising as a result of a breach of the Buyer Non-Fundamental Reps exceed the Closing Cap, and (iv) in no event shall the aggregate indemnification, compensation or reimbursement to be paid by Buyer for Losses under Section 6.3 exceed the Purchase Price. 

Section 6.6 Adjustments to Losses; Limitations on Remedies; Calculation of Losses. 

(a) 
If any Indemnifying Party is liable to pay an amount in discharge of any claim under this Agreement and any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates recovers from a third party (including any insurer but excluding any "self-insurance" maintained by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates) a sum which indemnifies, compensates or reimburses the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (in whole or in part) in respect of the Loss which is the subject matter of the claim, the Indemnified Party shall reduce or satisfy, as the case may be, such claim to the extent of such recovery less any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with receiving such recovery and any related increases in insurance premiums; provided, however, that in no event shall any Indemnified Party have any obligation to seek or enforce any recovery from such third party. 

(b) 
To the extent a Loss for which indemnification is provided results in a reduction of Taxes payable by, or a Tax refund to, the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (determined on a "with and without" basis) in the Taxable Period in which such Loss was accrued for Tax purposes or the following two (2) Taxable Periods (a "Tax Benefit"), then the amount of the indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article VI in respect of such Loss shall be reduced by the amount of such Tax Benefit. In the event such Tax Benefit is ultimately disallowed pursuant to a "determination," as defined in Section 1313 of the Code, the Indemnifying Party shall pay, no later than fifteen (15) days following the date of such determination, to the Indemnified Party the amount by which such indemnity payment was reduced as a result of the Tax Benefit. If any such Tax Benefit is not actually realized prior to the time the related indemnification payment is made, the Indemnified Party thereafter shall make payments in accordance with this Article VI to the Indemnifying Party to reflect such Tax Benefit. 

(c) 
No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from any Indemnifying Party (i) under this Article VI more than once in respect of the same Loss (notwithstanding that 

(d)

(ii) 
for any punitive or exemplary damages, unless in each case of (i) and (ii), awarded by an arbitrator or Governmental Authority to a third party and paid to such third party by an Indemnified Party, (iii) for lost opportunities and (iv) for diminution or reduction in value premised upon application of a multiplier of any financial measure or of any similar item (including the application of a multiplier to loss of revenue, income or profits, loss of business reputation, goodwill or opportunity). 

(e) 
Any Indemnified Party's right to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Article VI based on any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement or any breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of an Indemnifying Party under this Agreement shall not be diminished or otherwise affected in any way as a result of the existence of such Indemnified Party's knowledge of such breach, inaccuracy or nonperformance as of the date of this Agreement, regardless of whether such knowledge exists as a result of the Indemnified Party's investigation or as a result of disclosure by such Indemnifying Party (other than in the Disclosure Letter or in the GM SEC Filings). 

(f) 
(i) In the event that payment is to be made by the Company to any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 6.2 in respect of any Losses, the Company shall pay any such obligations owed to a Buyer Indemnified Person in an amount equal to (x) such Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.2 divided by (y) the Non-Buyer Equity Percentage at the time of such Loss, and (ii) in the event that payment is to be made by the Buyer to the Company pursuant to Section 6.3 in respect of any Losses, the Buyer shall pay any such obligations owed to the Company in an amount equal to (x) such Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.3 divided by (y) the Non-Buyer Equity Percentage at the time of such Loss. 


24 
25 
Section 6.7 Payments. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party the amount of any Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is liable hereunder, in immediately available funds, to an account specified by the Indemnified Party no later than fifteen (15) days following any Final Determination of such Losses and the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor. A "Final Determination" shall exist when (a) the parties to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (b) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable Order or judgment with respect to the subject matter of the claim or (c) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to disputes the Parties have agreed to submit thereto. 
Section 6.8 Mitigation. The Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party under this Article VI, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate to the extent required by Law after becoming aware of any such claim. 
26 
Section 6.9 Exclusive Remedy. Other than for claims of intentional fraud based on a false representation in Article III or Article IV, the remedies set forth in this Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for any breach or alleged breach of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the remedies available in this Article VI supersede any other remedies available at law or in equity including rights of rescission and claims arising under applicable Law, and each Party hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, remedies, claims and causes of action, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law, that any Party may have against another Party in respect of any breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.9 shall not operate to (i) limit the rights of the Parties with respect to claims of intentional fraud based on a false representation in Article III or Article IV, (ii) limit the rights of the Parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief) in accordance with Section 7.11 to require a Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) limit any Party's rights or obligations pursuant to any other Transaction Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. No past, present or future Representative of any Party (collectively, the "Non-Party Affiliates") shall have any liability (whether in Law (including in contract or in tort), in equity or otherwise) related to this Agreement or for any claim or Legal Proceeding based on, in respect of or by reason of the Transactions except to the extent agreed to in writing by such Non-Party Affiliate (including pursuant to the terms and conditions of any Transaction Agreement). 
Section 6.10 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Parties shall treat each payment made under this Article VI as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. 
Section 7.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 7.8 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

Section 7.11 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy.

(xiii)  imposing restrictions on any Awards at the time of grant in the applicable Award Agreement or taking other Committee action with respect to confidentiality and other restrictive covenants as it deems necessary or appropriate;  
(xiv)  imposing "blackout periods" or other periods during which Options may not be exercised or Awards may not be settled;  
(xv)  within the limitations of the Plan, modifying or assuming outstanding Awards or accepting the cancellation of outstanding Awards (including stock units granted by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Awards for the same or a different number of shares and with the same or different vesting provisions; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein other than pursuant to Section 4(c) and Section 12, no modification of an Award shall, without the consent of the  
6  

(xvi) adopting such plans or subplans as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to provide for the participation by Participants who reside outside the U.S., which plans and/or subplans shall be attached hereto as Appendices; and 
(xvii) delegating some or all of the administration of the Plan to Members, one or more employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other committee of the Board. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan with the Committee and may, at any time, reinstate in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated. 
The Committee may adopt such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan. The Committee's determinations under the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons. 
4. SHARE LIMITATION. 
(a) 
Shares. The aggregate number of Common Shares that may be issued or used for reference purposes or with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan shall not exceed 750,000 shares (subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4(b) and Section 4(c) hereof) (the "Share Reserve"). If any Award expires, is forfeited, terminates or is canceled for any reason without having been exercised or settled in full a ("Forfeited Award"), the number of Common Shares underlying the Forfeited Award shall again be available for the purpose of Awards under the Plan. If there are any accrued but unpaid Distributions in respect of a Forfeited Award, the Committee may, but shall not be required to, allocate or award such Distributions on any basis it elects, including pursuant to the grant of a new Award. In addition, any Common Shares exchanged by a Participant or withheld from a Participant as full or partial payment to the Company of the exercise price or tax withholding upon exercise, vesting, settlement or payment of an Award under the Plan shall be added back to the foregoing maximum share limitation and may be made subject to Awards under the Plan pursuant to such limitation. 

(b) 
Changes. The existence of the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Committee or the Members, in accordance with the LLC Agreement, to make or authorize (i) any adjustment (including any issuance of Shares), recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or its business, (ii) any merger or consolidation of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iii) any issuance of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Common Shares, (iv) the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (v) any sale or transfer of all or part of the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates or (vi) any other corporate act or proceeding relating to the Company any of its Affiliates. 

(c) 
Adjustments to Capital Structure. Subject to the provisions of Section 12: 


7 
(i) 
If the Company at any time subdivides (by any split, recapitalization or otherwise) the outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of Common Shares, or combines (by reverse split, combination or otherwise) its outstanding Common Shares into a lesser number of Common Shares, then the respective exercise prices for outstanding Awards that provide for a Participant elected exercise and the number of Common Shares covered by outstanding Awards, as well as the Share Reserve, shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under the Plan. 

(ii) 
Excepting transactions covered by Section 4(c)(i), if the Company effects any merger, consolidation, statutory exchange, spin-off, reorganization, sale or transfer of all or substantially all the Company's assets or business, or other corporate transaction or event in such a manner that the Company's outstanding Common Shares are converted into the right to receive (or the holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive in exchange therefor), either immediately or upon liquidation of the Company, securities or other property of the Company or other entity, then, subject to the provisions of Section 12, (1) the aggregate number or kind of securities that thereafter may be issued under the Plan, (2) the number or kind of securities or other property (including cash) to be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan (including as a result of the assumption of the Plan and the obligations hereunder by a successor entity, as applicable), or (3) the exercise or purchase price thereof, shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under the Plan. 


(iii) If there shall occur any change in the capital structure of the Company other than those covered by Section 4(c)(i) and 4(c)(ii), including by reason of any extraordinary dividend (whether cash or equity), any conversion, any adjustment, any issuance of any class of securities convertible or exercisable into, or exercisable for, any class of Equity Securities of the Company, then the Committee shall adjust any Award and make such other adjustments to the Plan to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any "equity restructuring" (within the meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor pronouncement thereto)), the Committee shall make an equitable or proportionate adjustment to outstanding Awards to reflect such equity restructuring. 
(iv) Any such adjustment determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all Participants and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted assigns. Any adjustment to, or assumption or substitution of, an Award under this Section 4(c) shall be intended to comply with the 
8 
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and Treasury Regulation §1.424-1 (and any amendments thereto), to the extent applicable. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4 or in the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant shall have no additional rights under the Plan by reason of any transaction or event described in this Section 4. 
(d) Minimum Purchase Price. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if authorized but previously unissued Common Shares are issued under the Plan, such shares shall not be issued for any consideration less than that required by applicable law. 
5. GENERAL. 
(a) 
General Eligibility. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, only Participants shall be eligible to receive Awards under the Plan. 

(b) 
Award Agreement. Each Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed by an Award Agreement between the Participant and the Company, which may be in electronic or written form, and may vary to accommodate local applicable law. Such Award shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in the applicable Award Agreement (including, without limitation, any performance conditions to which such Award will be subject). The provisions of the various Award Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. 

(c) 
Joinder to LLC Agreement. In connection with the grant, vesting, and/or exercise of any Award, to the extent that a Participant is not already a party to the LLC Agreement, the Committee may require such Participant to execute and become a party to such LLC Agreement as a condition of such grant, vesting, and/or exercise of any Award by executing and delivering to the Company a joinder to the LLC Agreement. Without prejudice to Sections 2.03 (Class B Common Shares) and 2.08 (Repurchase Rights) of the LLC Agreement, to the extent that there is any conflict between the terms of the Plan and the LLC Agreement, the Plan shall govern and control. 


6. STOCK OPTIONS. The Committee shall have the right and power to grant Options to any Participant, at any time prior to the termination of this Plan, with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions, in either case, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine. 
(a) 
The exercise price per Share under an Option shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that such exercise price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such Option. 

(b) 
The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee but shall not exceed ten (10) years from the date of grant of such Option in the form of a non-qualified stock option. 

(c) 
The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part, subject to Section 11. 

(d) 
The Committee shall determine the method or methods by which, and the form or forms, including cash, Shares, other Awards, other property, net settlement, broker assisted cashless exercise or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the relevant exercise price, in which payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made. To the extent that any Shares held by the Participant are used for payment of the exercise price, such Shares shall not be subject to any pledge or other security interest and, unless determined otherwise by the Committee, shall have been held by the Participant for at least such period as may be required in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment applying generally accepted accounting principles. 

(e) 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no dividends or dividend equivalents will be earned or paid on the Shares underlying any Options granted and outstanding under the Plan. 


9 
7. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS ("SARs"). The Committee is authorized to grant SARs to Participants with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions, in either case not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine. 
(a) 
SARs may be granted under the Plan to Participants either alone ("freestanding") or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan ("tandem") and may, but need not, relate to a specific Option granted under Section 5(c). 

(b) 
The exercise price per Share under a SAR shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that such exercise price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such SAR. 

(c) 
The term of each SAR shall be fixed by the Committee but shall not exceed ten (10) years from the date of grant of such SAR. 

(d) 
The Committee shall determine the time or times at which a SAR may be exercised or settled in whole or in part, subject to Section 11. 

(e) 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no dividends or dividend equivalents will be earned or paid on the Common Shares underlying any SARs granted and outstanding under the Plan. 


8. RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. The Committee is authorized to grant Awards of Common Shares subject to restrictions on transfer ("Restricted Stock") and restricted stock units, the value of which is based on or that may be settled into Common Shares ("RSUs") to Participants with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions, in either case not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine. 
10 
(a) 
Awards of Restricted Stock and RSUs shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including any limitation on the right to receive any dividend, dividend equivalent or other right), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times, in such installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate. 

(b) 
With respect to Awards of Restricted Stock, a Participant generally shall have the rights and privileges of an Employee Member with respect thereto, to the extent, and subject to any limitation, in the LLC Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Award relates to Common Shares on which dividends are declared during the period that the Award is outstanding, such dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash on the vesting date of the Restricted Stock Award, subject to satisfaction of the vesting and other conditions of the underlying Award of Restricted Stock, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Any Restricted Stock Award may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration. For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no dividends or dividend equivalent rights shall be provided with respect to any Award of Restricted Stock that does not vest pursuant to their terms. 

(c) 
With respect to an RSU Award, each RSU covered by such Award shall represent a right to receive the value of one Common Share in cash, Common Shares or a combination thereof. An RSU shall not convey to the Participant the rights and privileges of an Employee Member with respect to the Common Share subject to the RSU, such as the right to vote or the right to receive dividends, unless and until a Common Share is issued to the Participant to settle the RSU. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, RSU Awards shall convey the right to receive dividend equivalents on the Common Shares underlying the RSU Award with respect to any dividends declared during the period that the RSU Award is outstanding. Such dividend equivalent rights shall accumulate and shall be paid in cash following the settlement date of the underlying RSU Award, subject to the satisfaction of the vesting and other conditions of the underlying RSU Award, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Common Shares delivered upon the vesting and settlement of an RSU Award may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration. For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no dividend equivalent rights shall be provided with respect to any Common Shares subject to RSUs that do not vest or settle pursuant to their terms. 


9. PERFORMANCE AWARDS. The Committee is authorized to grant Awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions ("Performance Awards") with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions, in either case not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine: 
(a) Performance Awards may be denominated as a cash amount, number of Common Shares or units or a combination thereof and are Awards which may be earned upon 
11 
achievement or satisfaction of performance conditions specified by the Committee. In addition, the Committee may specify that any other Award shall constitute a Performance Award by conditioning the grant or the right to exercise the Award or have it settled, and the timing thereof, upon achievement or satisfaction of such performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the performance goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance period, the amount of any Performance Award granted and the amount of any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award shall be determined by the Committee. 
(b) 
The Committee may provide that any Performance Award will vest based on one or more of the following performance measures, or any other performance measure determined by the Committee, in each case as expressed on an absolute or adjusted basis with respect to the Company or any Affiliate thereof: asset turnover, cash flow, contribution margin, cost objectives, cost reduction, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), earnings per share, economic value added, free cash flow, increase in customer base, inventory turnover, liquidity, market share, net income, net income margin, operating cash flow, operating profit, operating profit margin, pre-tax income, productivity, profit margin, quality (internal or external measures), return on assets, return on net assets, return on capital, return on invested capital, return on equity, revenue, revenue growth, equity value, stock price, total shareholder return, and/or warranty experience. 

(c) 
Each performance criterion may be measured on an absolute (e.g., plan or budget) or relative basis. Relative performance may be measured against a group of peer companies, a financial market index or other acceptable objective and quantifiable indices which the Committee selects. With respect to the applicable performance period, if the Committee determines that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of the Company, or the manner in which it conducts its business, or other events or circumstances render the applicable performance measures unsuitable, the Committee may in its discretion modify such performance objectives or the related minimum acceptable level of achievement, in whole or part, as the Committee deems appropriate and equitable. Performance measures may vary from Performance Award to Performance Award, respectively, and from Participant to Participant, and may be established on a stand-alone basis, in tandem or in the alternative. 

(d) 
A Performance Award shall not convey to the Participant the rights and privileges of an Employee Member with respect to the Common Shares subject to the Performance Award, such as the right to vote (except as relates to Restricted Stock) or the right to receive dividends, unless and until Common Shares are earned pursuant to the Performance Award and are issued to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, each Performance Award shall convey the right to receive dividend equivalents with respect to any dividends declared during the period that the Performance Award is outstanding, but solely with respect to those Common Shares underlying the Performance Awards that are earned. Such dividend equivalents rights 


12 
shall accumulate and shall be paid in cash on the settlement date of the underlying Performance Award, subject to the satisfaction of the performance, vesting and other conditions of the underlying Performance Award, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no dividend equivalent rights shall be provided with respect to any Shares subject to a Performance Award that are not earned or do not vest pursuant to the terms of the Performance Award. 
10. 
OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS. The Committee is authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to any Participant, at any time prior to the termination of this Plan, such other Awards that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, Common Shares or factors that may influence the value of Common Shares, including convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares, purchase rights for Shares, Awards with value and payment contingent upon performance of the Company or business units thereof or any other factors designated by the Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no dividend equivalent rights shall be provided with respect to any Shares subject to an Award that are not earned or do not vest pursuant to the terms of the Award. Other Stock- Based Awards will be evidenced by Award Agreements containing the terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee. 

11. 
EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE ON AWARDS. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in any Award Agreement, or as the Committee may determine in any individual case, the following shall apply with respect to a Participant's outstanding Awards upon such Participant's Termination Date. 

(a) 
Death. In the event of a Participant's Termination Date due to death: 

(i) 
Each Option and SAR held by the Participant that is vested and exercisable shall remain exercisable until the third anniversary of the date of death or, if earlier, the expiration date of such Option or SAR. Each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant that has not vested as of the Participant's Termination Date shall immediately be forfeited on the Participant's Termination Date. 

(ii) 
Each outstanding vested Restricted Stock and RSU Award held by the Participant shall be settled within sixty (60) days following the Participant's Termination Date. Each outstanding Restricted Stock and RSU Award held by the Participant that has not vested as of the Participant's Termination Date shall immediately be forfeited on the Participant's Termination Date. 


(iii) Each outstanding vested Performance Award held by the Participant shall be paid or settled on the scheduled settlement date or dates as provided under the terms of the applicable Award Agreement. Each outstanding Performance Award held by the Participant that has not vested as of the Participant's 

(b) 
Disability. In the event of a Participant's Termination Date due to Disability: 

(i) 
Each Option and SAR held by the Participant that is vested and exercisable shall remain exercisable until the third anniversary of the Participant's Termination Date or, if earlier, the expiration date of such Option or SAR. Each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant that has not vested as of the Participant's Termination Date shall immediately be forfeited on the Participant's Termination Date. 

(ii) 
Each outstanding vested Restricted Stock and RSU Award held by the Participant shall be settled within sixty (60) days following the Participant's Termination Date. Each outstanding Restricted Stock and RSU Award held by the Participant that has not vested as of the Participant's Termination Date shall immediately be forfeited on the Participant's Termination Date. 


(iii) Each outstanding vested Performance Award held by the Participant shall be paid or settled on the scheduled settlement date or dates as provided under the terms of the applicable Award Agreement.

(c) 
Other Terminations. In the event of a Participant's Termination Date for any reason not specified in this Section 11 and subject to Section 13 hereof, the Participant shall not be entitled to retain any unvested portion of an Award; provided that (A) any Option or SAR that is vested on the Termination Date shall remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of (i) the applicable expiration date of such Option or SAR or (ii) ninety (90) days after the Termination Date, 

(B) 
each outstanding vested Restricted Stock and RSU Award held by the Participant shall be settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable Award Agreement and (C) each outstanding vested Performance Award held by the Participant shall be paid or settled on the scheduled settlement date or dates as provided under the terms of the applicable Award Agreement. 

(d) 
Terminations Pursuant to Approved Separation Agreement or Program. Notwithstanding the above provisions, in the event of a Participant's Termination Date pursuant to an approved separation agreement or program, such Participant will not be entitled to retain any unvested portion of an Award; provided that (A) any Option or SAR that is vested on the Termination Date shall remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of (i) the applicable expiration date of such Option or SAR or (ii) ninety (90) days after the Termination Date, (B) each outstanding vested Restricted Stock and RSU Award held by the Participant shall be settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable Award Agreement and (C) each outstanding vested Performance Award held by the Participant 

(e) 
Alternative Treatment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide for any alternative treatment of outstanding Awards, and the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, any such Awards may be exercised, settled, vested, paid or forfeited in the event of a Participant's Termination Date or the exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award, either in an Award Agreement or, subject to Section 12, by Committee action after the grant of an Award. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or otherwise determined by the Committee, a qualifying leave of absence shall not constitute a Termination Date. Any Participant's absence or leave shall be deemed to be a qualifying leave of absence if so provided under the Company's employee policies or if approved by the Company's chief human resources officer (or such individual holding a comparable role in the event of a restructuring of positions or re-designation of titles). 



12. 
EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL ON AWARDS. 


13 
14 
(a) In the event of a Change in Control and unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, outstanding Options and SARs shall be treated as described in subsection (i) below, outstanding Restricted Stock and RSUs shall be treated as described in subsection (ii) below and outstanding Performance Awards shall be treated as described in subsection (iii) below. 
(i) 
If in connection with the Change in Control, any outstanding Option or SAR is continued in effect or converted into an option to purchase or right with respect to cash or stock of the successor or surviving entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof) which conversion shall comply with Sections 424 (to the extent applicable) and 409A of the Code, then upon the occurrence of a Participant's Termination Date by the successor or surviving entity without Cause within twenty-four (24) months following the consummation of such Change in Control, such Option(s) or SAR(s) held by such Participant shall vest and become exercisable and shall remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of its full specified term or the first anniversary of such Termination Date. If outstanding Options or SARs are not continued or converted as described in this subsection, such Options or SARs shall vest and become fully exercisable effective immediately prior to the Change in Control (in a manner facilitating full exercise, including cashless exercise by Participants subject to the Change in Control) and any Options or SARs not exercised prior to the Change in Control shall be cancelled without consideration effective as of the Change in Control. 

(ii) 
If in connection with the Change in Control, any outstanding Restricted Stock or RSU is continued in effect or converted into a restricted stock or unit representing an interest in cash or stock of the successor or surviving entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof) on a basis substantially equivalent to the consideration received by Members of the Company in connection 


15 
with the Change in Control, then upon the occurrence of a Participant's Termination Date by the successor or surviving entity without Cause within twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, such restricted stock or unit(s) held by such Participant shall vest and, in the case of units, be immediately due and payable. If outstanding Restricted Stock or RSUs are not continued or converted as described in this subsection, such Restricted Stock or RSUs shall vest and, in the case of RSUs, be due and payable effective immediately prior to the Change in Control. 
(iii) With respect to each outstanding Performance Award, (A) the performance period shall end as of the date immediately prior to such Change in Control and the Committee shall determine the extent to which the performance criteria applicable to such Performance Award have been satisfied at such time, (B) the portion of such Performance Award that is deemed to have been earned pursuant to clause (A) above shall be converted into a time-vesting Award of equivalent value to which any service vesting requirements applicable to the predecessor Performance Award shall continue to apply and (C) the converted time-vesting Award shall be paid or settled on the settlement date or dates as provided under the terms of the predecessor Performance Award that would have applied had a Change in Control not occurred; provided that upon the occurrence of a Participant's Termination Date by the successor or surviving entity without Cause within twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, any service vesting requirements applicable to any such converted Award shall be deemed to have been met and such converted Award shall be immediately paid or settled upon such Termination Date. 
(b) In addition, in the event of a Change in Control and to the extent not less favorable to a Participant than the provisions of Section 12(a) above or the applicable Award Agreement, the Board, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, either by the terms of the Award or by action taken prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, may take any one or more of the following actions whenever the Board determines that such action is appropriate or desirable in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or to facilitate the Change in Control transaction: 
(i) 
to terminate or cancel any outstanding Award in exchange for a cash payment (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the Change in Control, the Board determines that no amount would have been realized upon the exercise of the Award or other realization of the Participant's rights, then the Award may be cancelled by the Company without payment of consideration); 

(ii) 
to provide for the assumption, substitution, replacement or continuation of any Award by the successor or surviving entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof) with cash, securities, rights or other property to be paid or issued, as the case may be, by the successor or surviving corporation (or a parent 


16 
or subsidiary thereof), and to provide for appropriate adjustments with respect to the number and type of securities (or other consideration) of the successor or surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary thereof), subject to any replacement awards, the terms and conditions of the replacement awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect thereto) and the grant, exercise or purchase price per share for the replacement awards; 
(iii) to make any other adjustments in the number and type of securities (or other consideration) subject to outstanding Awards and in the terms and conditions of outstanding Awards (including the grant or exercise price andperformance criteria with respect thereto) and Awards that may be granted in the future; and 
(iv) to provide that any Award shall be accelerated and become exercisable, payable and/or fully vested with respect to all Common Shares covered thereby, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement. 
(c) Prior to any payment or adjustment contemplated under this Section 12, the Committee may require a Participant to (i) represent and warrant as to the unencumbered title to the Participant's Awards; (ii) bear such Participant's pro rata share of any post- closing indemnity obligations and be subject to the same post-closing purchase price adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and similar conditions as the other holders of Common Shares, subject to any limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) deliver customary transfer documentation as reasonably determined by the Committee. 
13. COMPANY CALL RIGHTS; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. 
(a) Company Call Rights. Except as otherwise set forth in any Award Agreement, the following provisions will apply to all Awards granted under the Plan: 
(i) 
In the event of a Participant's Termination Date in the event of Cause, Termination Date prior to the date on which a Common Share issued in respect of any Award has vested, or a Material Breach, the Company may at any time during the period commencing on the Termination Date or date of Material Breach and ending on the first anniversary of the Termination Date or Material Breach repurchase from the Participant any Common Shares previously acquired by the Participant through the exercise, grant or payment of an Award under the Plan at a repurchase price equal to the lesser of (A) the original purchase price or exercise price (as applicable) of the share, if any, and (B) Fair Market Value of the Common Shares as of the date of repurchase. 

(ii) 
If the Company elects to exercise the rights under this Section 13, the Company shall do so by delivering to the Participant a notice of such election, 


17 
specifying the number of Common Shares to be purchased and the closing date and time of such purchase; provided, that unless determined otherwise by the Committee in no event shall the Company be obligated to deliver any such notice with respect to any Common Shares unless and until such Common Shares have been issued, vested (if applicable) and outstanding (and not subject to any pledge or other security interest) for such period as may be necessary in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment applying generally accepted accounting principles. Such closing shall take place within thirty (30) days following such notice at the Company's principal executive offices. At such closing, the Company shall pay the Participant the repurchase price as specified in this Section 13 in (A) cash, (B) a subordinated note, which will bear interest at the five (5)- year Applicable Federal Rate (compounded semiannually) and which will mature on the first to occur of (1) a Change in Control or (2) five (5) years following the date of issuance (the "Repurchase Note"), (C) by cancellation of indebtedness of the Participant, or (D) any combination of (A) through (C) chosen at the Board's discretion. The Company will be entitled to receive customary representations and warranties from the Participant regarding the Common Shares being repurchased including, but not limited to, the representation that the Participant has good and marketable title to the Common Shares to be repurchased free and clear of all liens, claims and other encumbrances. 
(iii) All repurchases shall be subject to applicable restrictions contained in the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and in the Company's and its Subsidiaries' debt financing agreements. If any such restrictions prohibit the repurchase of Common Shares for cash or the Repurchase Note as stated above, the Company shall have the right to delay payment of any outstanding Repurchase Notes; provided that such notes shall accelerate and be payable in full once the Company is permitted to repurchase the Common Shares or repay such notes under the debt financing agreements or, if earlier, upon a Change in Control. Any such notes issued by the Company shall be subject to any restrictive covenants in debt financing agreements to which the Company is subject at the time of the repurchase closing. If any such restrictions prohibit the repurchase of Common Shares for such subordinated notes, then the time periods provided herein for repurchases shall be suspended, and the Company may make such repurchases as soon as it is permitted to do so under such restriction. 
(iv) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, this Section 13(a) shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earlier to occur of a Change in Control or an Initial Public Offering. 
(b) Restrictions on Transfer. All Awards and all Common Shares acquired by the Participant (or the Participant's estate or legal representative) pursuant to an Award under the Plan are personal to a Participant and are not Transferable by such Participant, other than by will or pursuant to applicable laws of descent and distribution; provided that no 
18 
such Transfer by will or pursuant to applicable laws of descent and distribution shall be effective until the later of (i) ten 
(10) business days following the date that the Company receives written notice of such Transfer and (ii) the Company's receipt of a written certification from each Transferee stating that such Person is a U.S. citizen. Any attempted Transfer of the Awards or the Common Shares acquired by the Participant (or the Participant's estate or legal representative) pursuant to an Award under the Plan, which is not specifically permitted under this Plan, shall be null and void. Subject to Section 15(h) hereof, all Common Shares acquired by the Participant (or the Participant's estate or legal representative) pursuant to an Award under the plan shall no longer be subject to this Section 13(a) upon the earlier to occur of a Change in Control or an Initial Public Offering. 
14. 
UNFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN. 

The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments as to which a Participant has a fixed and vested interest but which are not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any right that is greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. 

15. 
MISCELLANEOUS. 

(a) 
Conditions Precedent to Awards. As a condition precedent to the vesting, exercise, payment or settlement of any portion of any Award at any time prior to a Change in Control, each Participant shall: (i) refrain from engaging in any activity which will cause damage to the Company or is in any manner inimical or in any way contrary to the best interests of the Company, as determined in the sole discretion of the Company's CEO or chief human resources officer (or such individuals holding a comparable role in the event of a restructuring of positions or re-designation of titles), (ii) for a period of twelve (12) months following any termination of employment or service, directly or indirectly, not knowingly induce any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary to leave his or her employment for participation, directly or indirectly, with any existing or future business venture associated with such Participant, and (iii) furnish to the Company such information with respect to the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions precedent as the Committee may reasonably request. In addition, the Committee may require a Participant to enter into such agreements as the Committee considers appropriate related to the subject matter of this Section 15(a). The failure by any Participant to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions precedent shall result in the immediate cancellation of the unvested portion of any Award and any portion of any vested Award that has not yet been exercised, paid or settled and such Participant will not be entitled to receive any consideration with respect to such cancellation. 

(b) 
Term. No Award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan on or after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the earlier of the Effective Date or the date of Member approval of the Plan, but Awards granted prior to such tenth (10th) anniversary may extend beyond that date and the terms and conditions of the Plan shall continue to apply to such Awards. 

(c) 
Member Approval. The Plan shall be submitted for the approval by the Members within twelve (12) months after the date of the Board's adoption of the Plan. 

(d) 
Legend. The Committee may require each person receiving Common Shares pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that the Participant is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof. In addition to any legend required by the Plan, the certificates, if any, for such shares may include any legend that the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on Transfer. All certificates for Common Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Common Shares is then listed or any national securities exchange system upon whose system the Common Shares is then quoted, any applicable federal or state securities law, and any applicable corporate law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 

(e) 
Securities Laws. This Plan has been instituted by the Company to provide certain compensatory incentives to the Participants and is intended to qualify for an exemption from the registration requirements (a) under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act, and (b) under applicable state securities laws. 

(f) 
Right to Amend or Terminate the Plan. The Board or Committee may amend or terminate the Plan or any Awards, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, provided that no such amendment or termination shall be made without Member approval to the extent that such approval is necessary to comply with any regulatory requirement applicable to the Plan. The termination of the Plan, any amendment thereof, or any amendment or termination of any Award shall not impair the rights or obligations of any Participant under any Award previously granted under the Plan without the Participant's consent, other than pursuant to Section 4(c) and Section 12. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after the Plan's termination. 

(g) 
Withholding. In a situation where, if a Participant were to receive Shares (by virtue of the exercise of any Option or the vesting or settlement of any Award), the Company or any of its Affiliates (or a former Affiliate) would be obliged to (or would suffer a disadvantage if it were not to) account for any tax or social security contributions in any jurisdiction for which that person would be liable by virtue of the receipt of such Shares or which would be recoverable from that person (together, the "Tax Liability"), the Option may not be exercised or the Award may not become vested or settled and the Shares may not be distributed unless that person has either (i) made a payment to the Company or any of its Affiliates (or such former Affiliates) of an amount at least equal to the Company's estimate of the Tax Liability or (ii) entered into arrangements acceptable to the Company or any of its Affiliates (or such former Affiliates) to secure that such a payment is made (whether by authorizing the sale of some or all of the shares on his or her behalf and the payment to the Company or any of its Affiliates (or such former Affiliates) of the relevant amount out of 




19 
20 
the proceeds of sale or otherwise). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, the foregoing withholding liability by (A) the delivery of Common Shares (which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest) owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value equal to such withholding liability or (B) having the Company withhold from the number of Common Shares otherwise issuable or deliverable pursuant to the exercise or settlement of the Award a number of shares with a Fair Market Value equal to such withholding liability (but no more than the maximum individual statutory rate for the applicable tax jurisdiction). 
(h) 
Lock-Up Period. As a condition to the grant of an Award, if requested by the Company and the lead underwriter of any public offering of the Common Shares (the "Lead Underwriter"), a Participant shall irrevocably agree not to sell, contract to sell, grant any option to purchase, transfer the economic risk of ownership in, make any short sale of, pledge or otherwise transfer or dispose of, any interest in any Common Shares or any securities convertible into, derivative of, or exchangeable or exercisable for, or any other rights to purchase or acquire Common Shares (except Common Shares included in such public offering or acquired on the public market after such offering) during such period of time following the effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act that the Lead Underwriter shall specify (the "Lock-Up Period"). The Participant shall further agree to sign such documents as may be requested by the Lead Underwriter to effect the foregoing and agree that the Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to Common Shares acquired pursuant to an Award until the end of such Lock-Up Period. 

(i) 
Beneficiaries. Unless stated otherwise in an Award Agreement, a Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries with respect to an Award by timely filing the prescribed form with the Company. A beneficiary designation may be changed by filing the prescribed form with the Company at any time before the Participant's death. If no beneficiary was designated or if no designated beneficiary survives the Participant, then after a Participant's death any vested Awards shall be settled and any cash payments shall be distributed to the Participant's estate. 

(j) 
Indemnification. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each member of the Committee or any delegate acting on behalf of or at the discretion of the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (i) any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan or any Award Agreement and (ii) from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. 

(k) 
Code Section 409A. The Plan is intended to either comply with or be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A. To the extent that the Plan is not exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and shall be limited, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Accordingly, the Company reserves the right to amend the provisions of the Plan at any time and in any manner without the consent of any Participant solely to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and to avoid the imposition of the additional tax, interest or income inclusion under Code Section 409A on any payment to be made hereunder while preserving, to the maximum extent possible, the intended economic result of the Award of any affected Participant. With respect to any Award that is considered "deferred compensation" subject to Code Section 409A, references in the Plan or any Award Agreement to "termination of employment" or "termination of service" (and substantially similar phrases) shall mean "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A. A Participant's right to receive installment payments pursuant to the Plan shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. 

Whenever a payment under the Plan specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event that the timing of payments in respect of any Award (that would otherwise be considered "deferred compensation" subject to Code Section 409A) would be accelerated upon the occurrence of (A) a Change in Control, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the event giving rise to the Change in Control satisfies the definition of a change in the ownership or effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation pursuant to Code Section 409A; or (B) a Disability, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the Disability also satisfies the definition of "Disability" pursuant to Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if a Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), no payments in respect of any Awards that are "deferred compensation" subject to Code Section 409A and which would otherwise be payable upon the Participant's "separation from service" (as defined in Code Section 409A) shall be made to such Participant prior to the date that is six (6) months after the date of such Participant's "separation from service" or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death; provided, that following any applicable six (6) month delay, all such delayed payments will be paid in a single lump sum on the earliest date permitted under Code Section 409A that is also a business day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest, income inclusion or other penalty that may be imposed on a Participant by Code Section 409A or for damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A unless such failure is a result of the Company's breach of this Plan or the Award Agreement. 

(l) 
No Right to be Granted Awards/Future Compensation. No employee, consultant, advisor, Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees, consultants, advisors, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. Any Award granted 


21 
22 
under the Plan shall be a one-time Award that does not constitute a promise of future grants. The Committee maintains the right to make available future grants under the Plan. Any Award granted hereunder is not intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant's normal or expected compensation, and in no way represents any portion of a Participant's salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose. 
(m) 
No Right to Continued Employment/Service. The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide services to, the Company. Further, the Company may at any time dismiss a Participant, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement or in any other agreement binding the parties. The receipt of any Award under the Plan is not intended to confer any rights on the receiving Participant except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. 

(n) 
Clawbacks. Any Awards granted under the Plan (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Awards) shall be subject to any applicable clawback or recoupment policies the Company has in place from time to time. 

(o) 
Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Board, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Board, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award Agreement, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

(p) 
Non-U.S. Participants. Awards may be granted to Participants who are non-United States nationals or employed or providing services outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Awards to Participants who are employed or providing services in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to recognize differences in local law, tax policy or custom. The Committee also may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of Awards in order to minimize the Company's obligation with respect to tax equalization for Participants on assignments outside their home country. 

(q) 
Governing Law and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Each Participant who accepts an Award thereby agrees that any suit, action or proceeding brought by or against such Participant in connection with this Plan shall be brought solely in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, each Participant consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such court and each Participant agrees to accept service of process by the Company or any of its agents in connection with any such proceeding. Each Participant who receives an Award hereby submits to and accepts 


23 
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court for the purpose of any such suit, legal action, or proceeding, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Participant who accepts an Award hereby irrevocably waives any objection which he or she may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue or any such suit, legal action or proceeding in such court and hereby further waives any claim that any suit, legal action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH PARTICIPANT WHO ACCEPTS AN AWARD IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THE PLAN OR ANY AWARD OR THE MATTERS OTHERWISE CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 
(r) Construction. The words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Where specific language is used to clarify by example a general statement contained herein (such as by using the words "such as"), such specific language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the general statement to which it relates. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in the Plan shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa.

Vesting; Forfeiture. 


(a) General. Vesting of the RSUs is conditioned on satisfaction of two vesting requirements before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Grant Date (unless earlier vested or forfeited pursuant to Sections 4(b) -(e) below): a time and service based requirement (the "Time-Vesting Condition") and a liquidity event requirement (the "Performance-Vesting Condition"), each as described in clauses (i) and (ii), respectively, below: 
(i) 
The Time-Vesting Condition will be satisfied with respect to (i) 10% of the aggregate Common Shares covered by the RSU on [l], (ii) 2.5% of the aggregate Common Shares covered by the RSU on the 15th day of each calendar quarter thereafter (for thirty-four (34) successive calendar quarters following the first (1st) anniversary of the Grant Date), and (iii) the final 5% vesting [l], provided, that the Participant's Termination Date has not occurred prior to each applicable date. 

(1) Notwithstanding Section 4(a)(i) hereof, to the extent not previously satisfied, the Time-Vesting Condition will be satisfied as to 100% of the aggregate Common Shares covered by the RSU as of the date on which the Board certifies in writing that the Fair Market Value per share is equal to or greater than $[l] (as adjusted pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Plan) for a period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days (which, following the occurrence of an Initial Public Offering, shall be determined by reference to the trailing ninety (90) day volume-weighted average closing per share price of the Common Shares over such period, and which, prior to the occurrence of an Initial Public Offering shall take into consideration the Company's then most-recently completed independent valuation obtained for purposes of compliance with Section 409A of the Code); provided, that the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company as an employee (and not solely in any other service provider capacity such as an independent contractor or member of the Board) through such date. 

(ii) 
The Performance-Vesting Condition will be satisfied on the earliest to occur of (A) the date of a Change in Control or (B) the consummation of an Initial Public Offering. 


In no event shall any of the RSUs vest unless a Change in Control or Initial Public Offering occurs on or before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Grant Date (the "End Date"). The portion of the RSU for which the Time-Vesting Condition has been satisfied as described in Section 4(a)(i) (including Section 4(a)(i)(1)) shall be referred to as the "Time-Vested Portion" and the RSU that becomes vested upon satisfaction of the Performance-Vesting Condition as described in Section 4(a)(ii) shall be referred to as the "Performance-Vested RSU." 
(b) Termination of Employment. 
(i) Subject to Sections 4(b)(ii), 4(c) and 4(e) hereof, and subject to the 
-3­
Participant's delivery and non-revocation of a Release (as defined below), upon a Participant's involuntary termination not for Cause, the Participant shall be entitled to receive accelerated vesting of the portion of RSUs that did not meet the Time-Vesting Condition held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's Termination Date with respect to that number of RSUs that would have become vested had the Participant remained continuously employed by the Company for twelve (12) months immediately following the date of termination. The Time- Vested Portion as of the Participant's Termination Date shall remain outstanding and eligible to satisfy the Performance-Vesting Condition until the End Date. For the purposes of this Award Agreement, "Release" means a general release of claims in a form acceptable to the Company. 
(ii) In the event of the Participant's Termination Date due to the Participant's death or Disability, the Time-Vesting Condition with respect to the RSUs that would have vested in the ordinary course in the twelve (12) months immediately following Participant's Termination Date due to death or Disability shall be deemed fully satisfied, and, in each case, such Time-Vested Portion as of the Participant's Termination Date shall remain outstanding and eligible to satisfy the Performance-Vesting Condition until the End Date for the benefit of the Participant or the Participant's executor or administrator (as applicable), or the person or persons to whom the Participant's rights under this Award Agreement shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution as the case may be, to the extent set forth herein or in the Plan. Any heir or legatee of the Participant shall take rights herein granted subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 
(c) Change in Control. If, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the RSUs are not converted or assumed in connection with such Change in Control, in either case, by a successor entity pursuant to the Plan, then, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, the RSUs shall, to the extent not previously canceled, become fully vested with respect to the Time-Vesting Condition immediately prior to such Change in Control, provided, that the Participant's Termination Date has not occurred prior to such Change in Control. If, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the RSUs are converted or assumed in connection with such Change in Control, in either case, by a successor entity pursuant to the Plan, then, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, if the Participant's Termination Date occurs by reason of a termination by the Company without Cause or as a result of the Participant's resignation of employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined below), in each case, within two (2) years following such Change in Control, the portion of the RSUs that have not satisfied the Time-Vesting Condition shall not be cancelled and the Time-Vesting Condition associated with such converted or assumed RSUs shall be deemed fully satisfied upon the Termination Date. 
(i) A Participant's resignation of employment for "Good Reason" shall mean Participant's resignation following any one of the following acts by the Company (or failures by the Company to act): (i) a material negative change in the nature or status of the Participant's responsibilities from those in effect as of the consummation of the Change in Control (the "Closing"); (ii) a material negative change in the Participant's base salary, except for any across-the-board reduction similarly affecting similarly-situated employees of the Company; or (iii) the 
-4­
relocation of the Participant's principal place of employment from the Participant's principal place of employment as of the Closing to a location that results in an increase in the Participant's daily commute of more than 50 miles in one direction; provided, however, in each case that (I) the Participant notifies the Company in writing of the circumstances giving the Participant the right to resign for Good Reason within thirty (30) days of the existence of such circumstances, (II) the Company fails to cure such circumstances within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, and (III) the Participant then terminates his or her employment within ninety (90) days of such failure to cure. If the Participant does not timely do so, the right to resign for Good Reason shall lapse and be deemed waived with respect to those circumstances. 
(d) 
Initial Public Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, upon an Initial Public Offering no accelerated vesting of the Time-Vesting Condition associated with the RSUs shall occur and upon a Participant's Termination Date following an Initial Public Offering, all outstanding RSUs shall be treated in accordance with Sections 4(b) and (e) hereof. 

(e) 
Forfeiture. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the RSU shall be forfeited and cancelled for no consideration at the earlier to occur of: 

(i) 
the End Date; 

(ii) 
the Participant's Termination Date in the event of a termination of Participant's employment for "Cause." For the sake of clarity, the entire RSU (any Time-Vested Portion and/or any Performance-Vested Portion, as well as any portion outstanding and unvested) shall terminate and expire upon the Participant's Termination Date in the event of a termination of Participant's employment for "Cause." For the purposes of this Award Agreement, a termination of the Participant's employment for "Cause" shall occur if: (i) the Participant has engaged in intentional acts of fraud, embezzlement, theft, commission of a felony or proven dishonesty in the course of his employment or service, or (ii) the Participant has committed a willful material breach of the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 2 (Nonsolicitation and Noninterference with Business Relationships), Section 3 (Nonsolicitation and Noninterference with Covered Persons), Section 4 (False Statements of Fact) and Section 5 (Confidential Information) of the attached Exhibit A, which are legally enforceable under California law; provided, however, in each case that (I) the Company notifies the Participant in writing of the circumstances giving the Company the right to terminate the Participant's employment for Cause within thirty (30) days of discovery by a majority of the members of the Board of the existence of such circumstances; provided that, prior to the earlier of a Change in Control or Initial Public Offering, such majority consists of all members of the Board who are employees of General Motors Company ("GM"), (II) the Participant fails to cure, if possible, such circumstances within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, and (III) the Company then terminates Participant's employment within ninety (90) days of such failure to cure. If the Company does not timely do so, the right to terminate Participant's employment for Cause shall lapse and be deemed 




-5­
waived with respect to those circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of "Cause" set forth in this Award Agreement shall, solely for purposes of this Award Agreement, supersede any other definition of "Cause" set forth in the Plan or any other agreement between the Participant and the Company. 
5. Settlement; Withholding. 
(a) 
Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Plan, the Company will deliver to the Participant the number of Common Shares equal to the portion of the RSU that has satisfied both the Time-Vesting Condition and the Performance-Vesting Condition no later than thirty (30) days following the applicable date on which both conditions are satisfied. 

(b) 
The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right and is hereby authorized to (but is not required to) withhold from this RSU, any payment due or transfer made under the RSU or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to the Participant the amount (in cash, Common Shares, other securities, other awards or other property) of any applicable withholding taxes in respect of this RSU and to take such action as may be necessary with respect to the RSU to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes (but no more than the maximum individual statutory rate for the applicable tax jurisdiction). Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Participant may, at his sole discretion, elect to have the Company withhold a number of RSUs upon the settlement of the Participant's RSUs otherwise to be settled with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of the Participant's income and employment tax withholding obligations having a value not exceeding the amount determined by using the applicable maximum required statutory tax withholding rates in the applicable jurisdiction and valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of withholding, with any fractional share amounts settled in cash. 


6. 
Distributions; Rights as Stockholder. Cash Distributions on the number of Common Shares issuable hereunder shall be credited to a Distribution book entry account on behalf of the Participant with respect to each RSU granted to the Participant, provided that such cash Distributions shall not be deemed to be reinvested in Common Shares and shall be held uninvested and without interest and paid in cash at the same time that the Common Shares underlying the RSUs are delivered to the Participant in accordance with the provisions hereof. Stock or property Distributions on Common Shares shall be credited to a Distribution book entry account on behalf of the Participant with respect to each RSU granted to the Participant, provided that such stock or property Distributions shall be paid, in the sole discretion of the Board, in (a) Common Shares, (b) in the case of a spin-off, shares of stock of the entity that is spun-off from the Company, (c) other property or (d) cash payments equal to the Fair Market Value of such stock or property Distributions, as applicable and in each case, at the same time that the Common Shares underlying the RSUs are delivered to the Participant in accordance with the provisions hereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Common Shares covered by any RSU unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares. 

7. 
Transferability. The RSU shall be subject to the transfer restrictions as provided under the Plan; provided, however, that upon advance written notice to the Company a transfer of the RSU shall be permitted in the event of transfers made to the Participant's family members, to family trusts or to Participant family controlled entities and/or pursuant to lawful domestic relations orders or agreements, in all cases without payment for such transfers to the Participant and pursuant to such

Subject to Sections 4(b) and 4(c) hereof, the Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to (i) 10% of the aggregate Common Shares covered by the Option on [l], (ii) 2.5% of the aggregate Common Shares covered by the Option on the 15th day of each calendar quarter thereafter (for thirty-four (34) successive calendar quarters following the first (1st) anniversary of the Grant Date), and (iii) the final 5% vesting on [l], provided, that the Participant's Termination Date has not 


occurred prior to each applicable date. The portion of the Option that has at any time become vested and exercisable as described above is hereinafter referred to as the "Vested Portion." 
(b) Termination of Employment. 
(i) 
Subject to Sections 4(b)(ii) and 4(c) hereof, and subject to the Participant's delivery and non-revocation of a Release (as defined below), upon a Participant's involuntary termination not for Cause, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the following: 

(1) 
continued payment of the Participant's base salary, in substantially equal installments, in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices, as in effect on the Participant's Termination Date (such amounts the "Salary Continuation Payments"), until the 12-month anniversary of the Participant's Termination Date. The first installment of the Salary Continuation Payments shall be paid to the Participant on the 60th day following the Participant's Termination Date; provided that the Release has become irrevocable as of such 60th day and shall include all installments that would otherwise have been paid prior to such date. The Participant's right to such Salary Continuation Payments shall survive until the option expiration date. For the purposes of this Award Agreement, "Release" means a general release of claims in a form acceptable to the Company; and 

(2) 
accelerated vesting and immediate exercisability of the portion of Options held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's Termination Date with respect to that number of Options that would have become vested and immediately exercisable had the Participant remained continuously employed by the Company for twelve (12) months immediately following the Participant's Termination Date. 



(ii) 
In the event of the Participant's Termination Date due to the Participant's death or Disability, the vesting conditions associated with the Options that would have vested in the ordinary course in the twelve (12) months immediately 


following Participant's Termination Date due to death or Disability shall be deemed fully satisfied, in each case, for the benefit of the Participant or the Participant's executor or administrator (as applicable), or the person or persons to whom the Participant's rights under this Award Agreement shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution as the case may be, to the extent set forth herein or in the Plan. Any heir or legatee of the Participant shall take rights herein granted subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 
(c) 
Change in Control. If, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Options are not converted or assumed in connection with such Change in Control, in either case, by a successor entity pursuant to the Plan, then, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, the Options shall, to the extent not previously canceled, become fully vested immediately prior to such Change in Control, provided, that the Participant's Termination Date has not occurred prior to such Change in Control. If, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Options are converted or assumed in connection with such Change in Control, in either case, by a successor entity pursuant to the Plan, then, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, if the Participant's Termination Date occurs by reason of a termination by the Company without Cause or as a result of the Participant's resignation of employment with the Company for "Good Reason" (as defined below), in each case, within two 

(2) 
years following such Change in Control, the portion of the Option that has not vested shall not be cancelled and the vesting conditions associated with such converted or assumed Option shall be deemed fully satisfied upon the Termination Date. 

(i) A Participant's resignation of employment for "Good Reason" shall mean Participant's resignation following any one of the following acts by the Company (or failures by the Company to act): (i) a material negative change in the nature or status of the Participant's responsibilities from those in effect as of the consummation of the Change in Control (the "Closing"); (ii) a material negative change in the Participant's base salary, except for any across-the-board reduction similarly affecting similarly-situated employees of the Company; or (iii) the relocation of the Participant's principal place of employment from the Participant's principal place of employment as of the Closing to a location that results in an increase in the Participant's daily commute of more than 50 miles in one direction; provided, however, in each case that (I) the Participant notifies the Company in writing of the circumstances giving the Participant the right to resign for Good Reason within thirty (30) days of the existence of such circumstances, (II) the Company fails to cure such circumstances within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, and (III) the Participant then terminates his or her employment within ninety (90) days of such failure to cure. If the Participant does not timely do so, the right to resign for Good Reason shall lapse and be deemed waived with respect to those circumstances. 

(d) 
Initial Public Offering. For the avoidance of doubt, upon an Initial Public Offering no accelerated vesting shall occur and upon a Participant's Termination Date following an Initial Public Offering, all outstanding Options shall be treated in accordance with Section 4(b) hereof. 


5. Exercise of the Option. 
(a) 
Period of Exercise. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the Participant may exercise all or any part of the Vested Portion of the Option at any time prior to the earliest to occur of: 

(i) 
the ten (10)-year anniversary of the Grant Date; 

(ii) 
three (3) years following the Termination Date where termination of employment is due to death or Disability; 


(iii) three (3) years following the Termination Date where termination of employment is by the Company without Cause (other than due to death or Disability) or by the Participant for any reason; or 
(iv) the Termination Date where termination of employment is by the Company for Cause or by the Participant if Cause exists at the time of resignation. For the sake of clarity, the entire Option (all vested and unvested portions) shall terminate and expire upon the Participant's termination under this Section 5(a)(iv). For the purposes of this Award Agreement, a termination of the Participant's employment for "Cause" shall occur if: (i) the Participant has engaged in intentional acts of fraud, embezzlement, theft, commission of a felony or proven dishonesty in the course of his employment or service or (ii) the Participant has committed a willful material breach of the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 2 (Nonsolicitation and Noninterference with Business Relationships), Section 3 (Nonsolicitation and Noninterference with Covered Persons), Section 4 (False Statements of Fact) and Section 5 (Confidential Information) of the attached Exhibit A, which are legally enforceable under California law; provided, however, in each case that (I) the Company notifies the Participant in writing of the circumstances giving the Company the right to terminate the Participant's employment for Cause within thirty (30) days of discovery by a majority of the members of the Board of the existence of such circumstances; provided that, prior to the earlier of a Change in Control or Initial Public Offering, such majority consists of all members of the Board who are employees of General Motors Company ("GM"), (II) the Participant fails to cure, if possible, such circumstances within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, and (III) the Company then terminates Participant's employment within ninety (90) days of such failure to cure. If the Company does not timely do so, the right to terminate Participant's employment for Cause shall lapse and be deemed waived with respect to those circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of "Cause" set forth in this Award Agreement shall, solely for purposes of this Award Agreement, supersede any other definition of "Cause" set forth in the Plan or any other agreement between the Participant and the Company. 
(b) Method of Exercise. 
(i) 
Subject to Section 5(a) and the terms of this Section 5(b), the Vested Portion of the Option may be exercised by initiating the transaction in Participant's Solium Shareworks account, or by contacting a Solium representitive; provided that the Option may be exercised with respect to whole Common Shares only. Such notice to Solium shall specify the number of Common Shares for which the Option is being exercised and shall be accompanied by payment in full of the exercise price as follows: (A) in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; or (B) solely to the extent permitted by applicable law, if the Common Shares are traded on a national securities exchange, and the Committee authorizes, through a procedure whereby the Participant delivers irrevocable instructions to a broker reasonably acceptable to the Committee to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the exercise price; (C) at the Participant's discretion, having the Company withhold Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option, or by payment in full or in part in the form of Common Shares owned by the Participant, based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares on the payment date as determined by the Committee or (D) on such other terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Committee. No Common Shares shall be issued until payment therefor, as provided herein, has been made or provided for, and the withholding obligation referred to in Section 8 herein is satisfied. 

(ii) 
Upon the Company's determination that the Option has been validly exercised as to any of the Common Shares, and the withholding obligation referred to in Section 8 herein is satisfied, the Company shall issue the Common Shares in the Participant's name by book-entry registration only. 



(c) 
In the event of the Participant's death, the Vested Portion of the Option shall remain exercisable by the Participant's executor or administrator, or the person or persons to whom the Participant's rights under this Agreement shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution as the case may be, to the extent set forth herein or in the Plan. Any heir or legatee of the Participant shall take the rights herein granted subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 


6. 
Legend on Certificates. If stock certificates representing the Common Shares purchased by exercise of the Option are issued, such certificates shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Board may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, daily stock exchange upon which such Common Shares are listed, and any applicable Federal or state laws, and the Board may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 

7. 
Transferability. The Option shall be subject to the transfer restrictions as provided under the Plan; provided, however, that upon advance written notice to the Company a transfer of the Option shall be permitted in the event of transfers made to the Participant's family members, to family trusts or to Participant family controlled entities and/or pursuant to lawful domestic relations orders or agreements, in all cases without payment for such transfers to the Participant 


8. Taxes. 
(a) 
The Participant shall be required to pay to the Company or any Affiliate the amount in cash of any applicable withholding taxes due in respect of this Option or its exercise, and this Option and the right to receive any Common Shares in respect thereof shall be terminated if this requirement is not satisfied. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right and is hereby authorized to (but is not required to) withhold from this Option, any payment due or transfer made under the Option or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in cash, Common Shares, other securities, other awards or other property) of such withholding taxes and to take such action as may be necessary with respect to the Option to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. 

(b) 
Without limiting the generality of clause (a) above, the Participant may, satisfy, in whole or in part, the foregoing withholding liability by delivery of Common Shares owned by the Participant (which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest), with a Fair Market Value equal to such withholding liability or by having the Company withhold from the number of Common Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Option a number of Common Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to such withholding liability (but no more than the maximum individual statutory rate for the applicable tax jurisdiction); provided, however, that Participant shall not be entitled to surrender shares to satisfy withholding obligations absent the Board's advance written consent if such withholding obligations would result in an aggregate annual income and employment tax cash deposit obligation by the Company in respect of the Participant's exercise(s) of all the Participant's options to purchase Common Shares (whether under this Option or any other Company option to purchase Common Shares held by the Participant) for any single calendar year of more than $50,000,000. 


9. 
Restrictive Covenant Violation. In the event of a willful material breach with respect to the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 2 (Nonsolicitation and Noninterference with Business Relationships), Section 3 (Nonsolicitation and Noninterference with Covered Persons), Section 4 (False Statements of Fact) and Section 5 (Confidential Information) of the attached Exhibit A, which are legally enforceable under California law, the Board may, in its discretion to the extent provided in this Section 9, terminate and cancel the Option, to the extent outstanding at the time the violation is discovered, and/or require the Participant to promptly return any Common Shares received upon any previous exercise of the Option (or, if the Participant transferred the Common Shares, a payment equal to the current Fair Market Value thereof) in exchange for the lesser of (a) the original exercise price of the Common Share and (b) the Fair Market Value of the Common Share as of the date of repurchase; provided, however, in each case that the Company seeks to invoke this Section 9, (I) the Company first notifies the Participant in writing of the circumstances giving the Company the right to invoke this Section 9 within thirty (30) days after the violation is discovered by a majority of the members of the Board; provided that, prior to the earlier of a Change in Control or Initial Public Offering, such majority consists of all members of the Board who are employees of GM, (II) the Participant fails to cure, if possible, such violation within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, and (III) the Company then determines, in its discretion, whether to terminate and cancel the Option and otherwise enforce its rights under this Section 9 within 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, the Participant's obligation to return any Common Shares received upon any previous exercise of the Option (or, if the Participant transferred the Common Shares, a payment equal to the current Fair Market Value thereof) shall in no event exceed the net after-tax number of Common Shares received by Participant upon any previous exercise of the Option after deducting all federal and state income and employment taxes which were payable by Participant upon the receipt of such Common Shares and (if the Participant has previously transferred any Common Shares) upon the transfer of such Common Shares. 

10. 
Conditions Precedent to Award Agreement. As a condition precedent to the vesting, exercise, payment or settlement of any portion of the Option at any time prior to a Change in Control, the Participant shall: (i) refrain from engaging in any activity that could reasonably be expected to cause material harm to the Company or is in any manner materially and intentionally inimical or in any way materially detrimental to the Company, in each case as determined by the Board in good faith and (ii) furnish to the Company such information with respect to the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions precedent as the Board may reasonably request. In addition, the Board may require Participant to enter into such agreements as the Board considers appropriate related to the subject matter of this Section 10. The failure by the Participant to satisfy either of the foregoing conditions precedent shall result in the immediate cancellation of the unvested portion of any Award and any vested Award that has not yet been exercised, paid or settled and the Participant will not be entitled to receive any consideration with respect to such cancellation; provided, however, that prior to the cancellation of any Award as described in this Section 10, (I) the Board notifies the Participant in writing of the circumstances giving the Company the right to cancel the Option within thirty (30) days after such circumstances are discovered by a majority of the members of the Board; provided that, prior to the earlier of a Change in Control or Initial Public Offering, such majority consists of all members of the Board who are employees of GM, (II) the Participant fails to cure, if possible, such circumstances within thirty (30) days following his receipt of such notice and (III) the Board then cancels the Participant's Option within ninety (90) days of such failure to cure; provided that, after the discovery of such circumstances giving the Company the right to cancel the Option and before the cancellation of the Option, the Participant is granted an opportunity to meet with the Board (with legal counsel, if desired) to address the existence of such circumstances. If the Board does not timely do so, the right to cancel the Participant's Option shall lapse and be deemed waived with respect to those circumstances.

(b) 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if at the time of the Participant's termination of employment with the Company, the Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Participant) until the date that is six months following the Participant's termination of employment with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code without any accelerated or additional tax) and (ii) if any other payments of money or other benefits due to the Participant hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code; or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Board, that is reasonably expected not to cause such an accelerated or additional tax. 

(c)

General Motors LLC, herein referred to as the "Employer", previously established the General Motors LLC U.S. Executive Severance Program (the "Program") effective February 2, 2016. The purpose of the Program is to provide for the payment of severance benefits to eligible executive employees of the Employer. This Program is not intended to alter the status of any executive or participant in the Program as an at-will employee, nor is it intended to create a contract of employment between any executive and General Motors LLC. 
ARTICLE II AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE PROGRAM 
Effective as of February 1, 2019, General Motors LLC amends and restates the General Motors LLC U.S. Executive Severance Program. With respect to any individual who separated from the Employer prior to the effective date of this amended and restated Program, such individual will continue to be bound by the terms of their existing separation arrangement, if any, and such individual will have no right or claim to separation pay under this amended and restated Program. Executives who are eligible for the Program and who are selected to participate in the Program are ineligible for severance benefits provided under any other severance program provided by the Company and its affiliates including the Employer, including the General Motors 2018 Executive Severance Program and the GM Severance Program.

ARTICLE IV ELIGIBILITY & PARTICIPTION 
4.1 Eligibility and Participation. Executives with one or more years of service who are working in the United States or who are U.S.-based executives working for the Employer outside of the United States (e.g., ISP assignments) are eligible to participate in the Program. In accordance with the terms of this Program, the Company may designate executives either individually or as a class of employees as eligible to receive Separation Pay under the Program. 
An Executive will neither be entitled to participate in the Program nor to receive Separation Pay if the Executive is subject to an individual agreement with the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the Employer, that provides for post-employment separation pay or benefits. For purposes of clarification only, participation in Company or Employer-sponsored executive compensation or benefit plans with a severance or change in control provision, such as the General Motors Long-Term Incentive Plan or the General Motors Executive Retirement Plan, by itself will not preclude an Executive from participation in this Program. 
4.2 Duration of Participation. Once an Executive becomes a Participant in the Program, subject to the other terms and conditions of the Program, the Executive will remain a Participant in the Program until the first to occur of the following: 
(a) 
The Executive's death; 

(b) 
The Executive's Termination of Employment due to Disability; 

(c) 
The Executive's movement into a position that is excluded from participation in the Program on its own or as a member of a class of employees that is not eligible to participate in the Program, other than following a Change in Control; 

(d) 
The Executive's involuntary Termination of Employment by the Employer other than by reason of the Executive's position elimination resulting from a reduction in force, a reorganization or a staffing reduction or a mutually agreed separation on terms satisfactory to the Employer; 

(e) 
The Executive's voluntary Termination of Employment in any case in which there is not a Change in Control; 

(f) 
The Executive's voluntary Termination of Employment without Good Reason following a change in control; 

(g) 
The Executive's involuntary Termination of Employment by the Employer for Cause; 

(h) 
The Executive's exclusion from participation in the Program by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Program; or 

(i) 
The termination of the Program. 


Subject to Sections 4.3 and 5.6 and the terms of an applicable Waiver and Release, the Company will not take action to reduce or eliminate Separation Pay once a Participant has been separated under this Program and becomes eligible for or commences receipt of Separation Pay, without the Participant's written consent. In no event will any Participant in the Program during the six-month period prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control be eliminated from participation during that period unless the Employer reasonably demonstrates that the elimination (a) was not at the request of a third party who has indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control, or (b) otherwise arose in connection with the Employer's ordinary operation of its business and without regard to the Change in Control which was threatened or proposed. Other than in the event of the Participant's voluntary Termination of Employment other than for Good Reason following a Change in Control, no Participant in the Program on the day immediately prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control can be eliminated from participation in the Program during the 24-month period commencing on the date of the Change in Control without the Participant's consent. 
4.3 Employees Offered Other Comparable Employment. If leadership extends continuing employment opportunities with the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the Employer, to a Participant who is eligible for Separation Pay under Section 5.1.1 at the same or at a comparable employment grade or level and at a level of compensation and benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided in the Participant's prior role, the Participant is expected to accept such offer of employment. Failure to accept such offer of employment will result in the affected Participant being ineligible for any further Separation Pay under this Program. 
A Participant may be eligible for the Separation Pay and benefits described herein in the event of the Participant's Termination of Employment under certain circumstances, including as a result of a Change in Control. 
5.1 Separation Pay. 
5.1.1 Position Elimination and Mutually Agreed Separations Other than Following a Change in Control. If the Participant's employment is involuntarily terminated by the Employer due to the elimination of the Participant's role with the Employer as a result of a reduction in force, a reorganization or a staffing reduction, or if the Employer and the Participant mutually agree to the Participant's Termination of Employment on terms satisfactory to the Employer, the Employer shall pay to the Participant in accordance with Section 5.3, a single payment in cash equal to (1) the specified multiple below times the Participant's annual base salary, plus (2) the specified multiple below times the Participant's annual target bonus amount, plus (3) the specified healthcare equivalent payment multiple below times the COBRA cost for the coverage level as most recently in effect for the Participant. The Employer shall also pay the Equity Equivalent amount identified below at or as soon as practicable following the time that the applicable equity vesting would occur had the Participant remained employed by the Employer during the 12 months following the Termination Date. The Participant will also receive 12 months of outplacement assistance. If a Participant's Termination of Employment occurs under the circumstances described in this paragraph in March or April of a particular year, the Employer shall pay to the Participant in accordance with Section 5.3, a single payment in cash equal to (1) the specified multiple below times the Participant's annual base salary, and (2) the specified healthcare equivalent multiple below times the COBRA cost for the coverage level as most recently in effect for the Participant. In the situation described in the preceding sentence, the Participant will receive neither the annual target bonus amount nor the Equity Equivalent amount identified below for equity vesting within the 12 months following the Termination Date.

5.1.2 Termination During the Change in Control Period. With respect to any Participant, if, during the Change in Control Period, the Participant's employment is terminated by the Company (or its successor) or its Subsidiaries, including the Employer for any reason other than Cause, or if the Participant voluntarily terminates their employment for Good Reason, the Employer shall pay to the Participant in accordance with Section 5.3(e), a single payment in cash equal to (1) the specified multiple below times the Participant's annual base salary, plus (2) the specified multiple below times the Participant's annual target bonus amount, plus 
(3) the specified healthcare equivalent payment multiple below times the COBRA cost for the coverage level as most recently in effect for the Participant.

CEO 2X 1X 24 Months 
SVP& Above 1.5X 1X 18 Months 
5.1.3 Termination Prior to a Change in Control. With respect to any Participant, if the Participant's employment is terminated by the Employer without Cause during the six-month period immediately prior to the date of a Change in Control, and the Participant is not otherwise eligible for Separation Pay under Section 5.1.1 or did not otherwise enter into an agreement with the Employer providing for the payment of separation pay following Termination of Employment, the Participant shall be entitled to the same Separation Pay as the Participant would have received pursuant to Section 5.1.2 above had such termination occurred during the Change in Control Period, unless the Employer reasonably demonstrates that the termination (a) was not at the request of a third party who indicated an intention or who had taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control, or 
(b) otherwise arose in connection with the Employer's ordinary operation of its business and without regard to the Change in Control which was threatened or proposed. 
5.2 Benefits Continuation. At the time of a Participant's Termination of Employment, the Participant shall be eligible to enroll in healthcare continuation coverage in accordance with COBRA, or other applicable equivalent, and provision of Separation Pay attributable to the healthcare equivalent payment multiple will not impact the Participant's eligibility to enroll in healthcare continuation coverage. 
5.3 Separation Pay Conditions. The receipt of payments as set forth under Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and Section 5.1.3 above is subject to the following conditions: 
(a) 
In exchange for the Separation Pay described herein, Participant shall be required to execute and deliver to Employer a Waiver and Release, unless such 

(b) 
The Participant shall remain in compliance with all Restrictive Covenants required of Participant as a condition of receipt of Separation Pay. 

(c) 
The Participant's Termination of Employment under this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code with the Employer and all persons with whom the Employer would be considered a single employer under Sections 414(b) and (c) of the Code. 

(d) 
If the Participant is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and as determined under the Employer's policy for determining specified employees) on the Participant's Termination Date, and the Participant is entitled to a payment under this Program that is required to be delayed pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such payment, shall not be paid or provided (or begin to be paid or provided) until the first business day of the seventh month following the Participant's Termination Date in the case of a termination covered by Section 5.1. or Section 5.1.2, or the first business day of the seventh month following the Change in Control in the case of a termination covered by Section 5.1.3. 

(e) 
Payment of amounts owing under this Agreement shall commence or be made on the following dates (or if not a business day, on the business day immediately following): (i) if the Participant is a "specified employee" as described in Section 5.3(d), on the date specified in Section 5.3(d); (ii) if the Participant is not a specified employee, and the Employer has requested a Waiver and Release, within 60 days following the date such Waiver and Release is effective as provided in Section 5.3(a) or the later Termination Date; and (iii) if the Participant is not a specified employee and the Employer has not requested a Waiver and Release, on or around the 60th day following the Termination Date, in the case of a payment due under Section 5.1.1 or 5.1.2, or on or around the 60th day following the effective date of the Change in Control, in the case of a payment due under Section 5.1.3. For Participants who are terminated under Section 5.3(e)(ii) above on and after November 15 of a particular year and for Participants who are terminated under Section 5.3(e)(iii) above on and after November 1 of a particular year, payment will be made at the latter of the second pay period in January or as soon as practicable following the date of the expiration of the review and revocation period under an applicable Waiver and Release, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which such termination occurred. 


5.4 Payments Treated as Parachute Payments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Program or any other plan, arrangement or agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments provided or to be provided by the Employer or its affiliates to the Participant or for the Participant's benefit pursuant to the terms of this Program or otherwise ("Covered Payments") are determined to be parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, with the effect that Participant is or would be liable for the payment of the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or any similar tax imposed by state or local law or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes (collectively, the "Excise Tax"), then the Compensation Committee shall determine the appropriate treatment of payments under this Program in its sole discretion consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code that produces the most advantageous economic outcome for the Participant, and its determination shall be final and binding on the Participant. The Employer shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Participant not later than 60 days following to the Termination Date, in the case of payments due under Section 5.1.1 or Section 5.1.2, or 60 days following the effective date of the Change in Control, in the case of payments due under Section 5.1.3. 
5.5 Additional Payments Following a Reduction. If the Participant is required by the IRS or another agency to make a payment or payments of Excise Tax with respect to such Covered Payments, the Participant shall remain solely responsible for such payment and the Employer shall bear no responsibility for such Excise Tax. 
5.6 No Mitigation Other than Re-Employment. Subject to Section 4.3 above, the Participant shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Program by seeking other employment or otherwise and no payment hereunder shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any compensation provided to the Participant in any subsequent employment. However, if a Participant commences re-employment with the Employer following a Termination of Employment described in Section 5.1.1, and continues to be eligible for Separation Pay in accordance with Section 5.1.1, the portion of Separation Pay attributable to the base salary multiple, short-term incentive plan targert multiple, and healthcare equivalent payment multiple will cease upon Participant's reemployment and Participant will be required to repay a prorated portion of Separation Pay based on the ratio of the number of days remaining in the 12-month period commencing on Participant's Termination Date to 365. For example, a Participant who is re-employed following 200 days of separation will be required to repay 45.2% (165/365) of the applicable Separation Pay received. 
5.7 Exclusion from Annual and Long-Term Incentive Program Resulting from Separation Agreement. A Termination of Employment resulting in a Participant's receipt of Separation Pay under Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2 or 5.1.3 of the Program constitutes a "termination of service pursuant to an approved separation agreement" for purposes of the General Motors Short-Term Incentive Plan. In no case is a Participant eligible to receive Separation Pay under Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2 or 5.1.3 of the Program and payment of a full-year or part-year annual incentive payment. With respect to the General Motors Long-Term Incentive Plan, a Termination of Employment resulting in a Participant's receipt of Separation Pay under Section 5.1.1 of the Program constitutes a "termination of service pursuant to an approved separation agreement". A Termination of Employment under Section 5.1.2 or 5.1.3 that results in the receipt of Separation Pay shall not constitute a "termination of service pursuant to an approved separation agreement" under the General Motors Long-Term Incentive Plan.

It is the intention of the Employer that if any provision of this Program is susceptible of two or more constructions, one of which would render the provision enforceable and other or others of which would render the provision unenforceable, then the provision shall have the meaning which renders it enforceable. 
8.9 Number and Gender. When used in this Program, the number and gender of each pronoun shall be construed to be such number and gender as the context, circumstances or its antecedent may require. 
8.10 Effect on Other Plans, Agreements and Benefits. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein, any benefit or compensation to which a Participant is or may be entitled under any agreement between the Participant and the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the Employer, or any plan, program or arrangement maintained by such entity in which Participant participates or 
participated shall not be modified or lessened in any way by operation of the Program, but shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan, program or arrangement. Nothing in this Program is intended to guarantee that the benefit levels or costs will remain unchanged in the future under any plan, program or arrangement of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the Employer, and the applicable plan sponsor reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, terminate or discontinue any other plan, program or arrangement maintained by such plan sponsor in accordance with the terms of that plan, program or arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, including the eligibility provisions of Section 4.1, a Participant's eligibility for severance under this Program is mutually exclusive with severance available to the Participant through any plan, program, or arrangement between the Participant or the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Participant, or pursuant to local statute. If a Participant is entitled to severance under this Program and any other arrangement between the Participant and the Employer or the Company or its Subsidiaries, or pursuant to the application of local statute, and the Participant is not otherwise excluded from participation in this Program pursuant to Section 4.1, or otherwise, the Participant will receive the greater of the severance under this Program or the other applicable severance. Any severance to which Participant becomes entitled will first be paid under this Program upon the requirement that Participant waive their claim to the other severance; provided, however, that if Participant's entitlement to such other severance cannot be waived, the amount of Separation Pay hereunder will be offset by the amount of such other required severance, but not below zero. Upon the Participant's Termination of Employment resulting in Separation Pay in accordance with Section 5.1.2 or Section 5.1.3, all non-competion arrangements applicable to a Participant, either pursuant to a Restrictive Covenant or otherwise, shall no longer apply to the Participant, and the Employer (or its successor) shall enter into a written agreement with the terminated Participant evidencing this point. For purposes of clarification, non-solicitation, non-disclosure, confidentiality and other provisions of applicable restrictive covenants will continue to apply to the Participant. 
8.11 Section 409A of the Code. It is intended that any amounts payable under this Program shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable, and this Program will be interpreted, administered and operated accordingly. Any payments (including reimbursements) under this Program that may be excluded from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service or as a short-term deferral shall be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. Neither the Employer nor the Compensation Committee or the Board shall have any liability to the Executive with respect to any failure to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 
8.12 Application of ERISA. The Program is intended to be an ERISA welfare benefit plan, and this Program document is intended to constitute the plan document and the summary plan description for the Program. 
8.13 Claims for Benefits. If you are a Participant in the Program and become eligible to receive Separation Pay under the Program, you will receive the amounts set forth under Section 5 of the Program for which you are entitled, provided you otherwise satisfy the conditions of the Progam for the receipt of such Separation Pay. If you feel you have not been provided with all benefits to which you are entitled under the Program, you may file a written claim with the Global 
Director of Executive Compensation, who is the "Claims Administrator", with respect to your rights to receive benefits from the Program. You will be informed of the Claims Administrator's decision with respect to your claim within 90 days after it is filed. Under special circumstances, the Claims Administrator may require an additional period of not more than 90 days to review your claim. If this occurs, you will be notified in writing as to the length of the extension, the reason for the extension, and any other information needed in order to process your claim. 
If your claim is denied, in whole or in part, you will be notified in writing of the specific reason for the denial, the exact Program provision on which the decision was based, what additional material or information is relevant to your claim, and what procedure you should follow to get your claim reviewed again. If you are not notified within the 90-day (or 180-day, if so extended) period, you may consider your claim to be denied. In either case, you then have 60 days to appeal the decision to the Senior Vice President of Human Resources, who is the "Appeal Administrator". 
Your appeal must be submitted in writing. You may submit a written statement of issues and comments. A decision as to your appeal will be made within 60 days after the appeal is received. Under special circumstances, the Appeal Administrator may require an additional period of not more than 60 days to review your appeal. If this occurs, you will be notified in writing as to the length of the extension, not to exceed 120 days from the day on which your appeal was received. 
If your appeal is denied, in whole or in part, you will be notified in writing of the specific reason for the denial and the exact Program provision on which the decision was based. The decision on your appeal will be final and binding on all parties and persons affected thereby. If you are not notified within the 60-day (or 120-day, if extended) period you may consider your appeal as denied.

This Agreement hereby supersedes and preempts the First A&R Agreement in all respects, and the First A&R Agreement shall hereafter be null and void. 
ARTICLE II CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; ISSUANCES OF SHARES 
2.01 Shares Generally. 
(a) 
All interests of the Members in Distributions and other amounts specified in this Agreement, as well as the rights of the Members to vote on, consent to or approve any matter for which a vote of Members is required under this Agreement or the Act, shall be denominated in shares of membership interests in the Company (each a "Share" and collectively, the "Shares"), and the relative rights, privileges, preferences and obligations of the Members with respect to Shares shall be determined under this Agreement to the extent provided herein. As of the date of this Agreement, the classes of Shares that the Company is authorized to issue are as follows: "Class A-1-A Preferred Shares", "Class A-1-B Preferred Shares" (collectively with the Class A-1-A Preferred Shares, the "Class A-1 Preferred Shares"), "Class A-2 Preferred Shares", "Class B Common Shares", "Class C Common Shares", "Class D Common Shares" and "Class E Common Shares".

(b)

Absent manifest error, the ownership interests recorded on the Members Schedule shall be a conclusive record of the Shares that are issued and outstanding. 

(c) 
A partial copy of the Members Schedule as of the date of the First A&R Agreement showing only the aggregate number of each class of Shares held by the Members as at such time (but not any identifying information about the Persons holding any Shares) was provided to SVF prior to the execution of the SoftBank Purchase Agreement and a partial copy of the Members Schedule as of the date of this Agreement showing only the aggregate number of each class of Shares held by the Members (but not any identifying information about the Persons holding any Shares) was provided to Honda prior to the execution of the Honda Purchase Agreement. Any amendment or revision to the Members Schedule made to reflect an action taken in accordance with this Agreement shall not be deemed an amendment to this Agreement. A current copy of the Members Schedule shall be held in confidence by the Company and maintained in a separate file conspicuously marked as confidential. A redacted version of the Members Schedule shall be made available to any Member at the request of such Member, which such redacted version will show only the Shares held by such Member and the aggregate number of issued and outstanding Shares held by other Members (and not, for clarity, any other identifying information about any other Person holding Shares). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the GM Investor, SoftBank and Honda shall be entitled to request a full and complete unredacted copy of the Members Schedule from time to time. 

2.02 Class A Preferred Shares; Class C Common Shares. 

(a) 
Pursuant to the SoftBank Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, SoftBank made Capital Contributions totaling $900,000,000 in the aggregate (the "SoftBank Commitment"), pursuant to which the Company has issued to SoftBank 900,000 Class A-1-A Preferred Shares. 

(b) 

(i) 
At any time that the Company determines, acting in good faith, that it is reasonably likely to be ready to commercially deploy vehicles in fully driverless operation (the date of readiness for such initial deployment, the "Commercial Deployment") within the following one hundred twenty (120) day period, the Company shall be entitled to deliver written notice of such determination to SoftBank (it being understood that delivery of such written notice (or failure to deliver such written notice) shall not be binding in any respect and the failure of Commercial Deployment to occur on such timetable shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by any Member or the Company). Following delivery of any such written notification, the Company and SoftBank (each acting reasonably and in good faith) will cooperate to identify and mutually agree upon, as promptly as reasonably practicable, whether any approvals, consents, registrations, permits or authorizations (or the expiration of any waiting periods) are required under the HSR Act or any comparable laws in any foreign jurisdiction (the "A-1-B Antitrust Approvals") in connection with the issuance of Class A-1-B Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(c). 

(ii) 
If any A-1-B Antitrust Approvals are identified and agreed pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(i) then each Class A-1 Preferred Member and each Class A-2 Preferred Member will (and will cause its Affiliates to) (A) make (as promptly as reasonably practicable) such notifications, registrations and filings necessary or advisable in connection with obtaining the A-1-B Antitrust Approvals and (B) without limiting the foregoing, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (as promptly as reasonably practicable) the A-1-B Antitrust Approvals. If the A-1-B Antitrust Approvals are not obtained (or, as applicable, any waiting period has not expired or early termination of any waiting period has not been granted) prior to end of the Payment Period, then the Payment Period will be extended until such A-1-B Antitrust Approvals are obtained or until the waiting periods with respect to such A-1-B Antitrust Approvals have expired or been terminated (as applicable); provided that, in order to obtain such A-1-B Antitrust Approvals, (1) none of GM nor any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall be required to offer or commit to hold separate, sell, divest or dispose, or suffer any restriction on the operation, of any assets, properties or businesses of GM Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (including the Company), and (2) none of SoftBank nor any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall be required to offer or commit to hold separate, sell, divest or dispose, or suffer any restriction on the operation, management, or governance of, any assets, properties or businesses of SoftBank or any portfolio companies (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) of SoftBank or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or, with the sole exception of the Company, any companies in which SoftBank or any of SoftBank's Subsidiaries or other Affiliates hold a minority equity position. 

(c) 

(i) 
Within three (3) Business Days of the date on which Commercial Deployment has occurred, the Company will provide written notice to SoftBank and the GM Investor of the same (such notice, the "CD Notice"). Subject to the satisfaction of the Second Tranche Conditions, within fifty (50) days (or such shorter period contemplated by the immediately following sentence) of the delivery of the CD Notice (such applicable period, the "Payment Period"), SoftBank will purchase and acquire from the Company, and the Company will issue, sell and deliver to SoftBank, a number of Class A-1-B Preferred Shares equal to $1,350,000,000 (the "Subsequent SoftBank Commitment") divided by the Class A-1-B Preferred Capital Value, in consideration for payment by SoftBank in full of such amount paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company and free and clear of any withholding. If GM, prior to the date that Commercial Deployment occurs, confirms (by way of a binding and irrevocable written notice to SoftBank (the "Advance Notice")) the definitive date on which Commercial Deployment will occur, then the Payment Period will be reduced by the aggregate number of days between the date the Advance Notice is delivered to SoftBank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the date of Commercial Deployment; provided, that in no event will the Payment Period be reduced to fewer than twenty five (25) days following the date on which Commercial Deployment occurs. 

(ii) 
If the Second Tranche Conditions have been satisfied but the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment is not fully paid by start of the Business Day following the final day of the Payment Period, then, automatically and without any further action by the Company or any Member (and without any recourse by any Member): (A) the provisions of Section 6.13(a) 


6 
7 
8 
through 6.13(d) will be suspended and cease to apply for such time as any amount of the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment is due and payable but remains unpaid, (B) the Class A-1 Preferred Return will cease to accrue on each Class A-1 Preferred Share (with, subject to the immediately following proviso, no catch-up right or right to be made whole if the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment is later paid in full; provided, that if the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment is paid in full within fifteen (15) days of the final day of the Payment Period (such fifteen (15) day period, the "Cure Period"), each Class A-1 Preferred Share will be entitled to the Class A-1 Preferred Return accrued during the period beginning on the final day of the Payment Period and ending on the date that the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment is fully paid), and (C) in the event that the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment is not paid in full by the end of the Cure Period, the amendments to this Agreement contemplated by Sections 2.02(d)(i) and Section 2.02(d)(ii) will apply and become effective from and after the final day of the Cure Period. 
(iii) The remedies provided for in Section 2.02(c)(ii) are in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other right of the Company or any other Member provided by law, this Agreement or any other agreement entered into by or among any one or more of the Members (or their Affiliates) or the Company (including any rights arising as a result of or in connection with a breach by SVF, SVFA or SoftBank of their obligations under Section 5.1 of the SoftBank Purchase Agreement). Each Member further acknowledges that any actions taken or not taken by the Company pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(ii) shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other duty stated or implied in law or equity to any Member. 
(d) 
If the SoftBank CFIUS Condition has not been satisfied prior to the occurrence of Commercial Deployment, then (without prejudice to the rights of GM or the Company arising as a result of or in connection with any breach by SVF, SVFA or SoftBank of their obligations under Section 5.1 of the SoftBank Purchase Agreement) upon the occurrence of Commercial Deployment, automatically and without any further action by the Company or any Member (and without any recourse by any Member): 

(i) 
the Class A-1 Preferred Return will (effective on and after the date of Commercial Deployment) be permanently reduced from a rate of seven percent (7%) per annum to a rate of three and a half percent (3.5%) per annum; 

(ii) 
the denominator in the definition of A-1-A Preferred Share Conversion Ratio will be permanently increased from $1,000 to $1,600; 


(iii) the conversion ratio for the Class A-2 Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 2.11(a), Section 9.07(a)(i), Section 9.10(a), clause (ii) of the definition of "Control Period", the definition of "SoftBank Floor Amount", clause (i) of the definition of "Optional SoftBank Conversion Share Price", the definition of "Per Class A-1 Preferred Share FMV" and clause (i) of the definition of "Preemptive Proportion" shall be adjusted from a 1:1 ratio to 0.625 of a Class C Common Share per one Class A-2 Preferred Share (as adjusted, as necessary, to reflect appropriate and proportional adjustments to take into account any subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of shares or similar event); and 
9 
(iv) Section 6.13(c) will be amended to read, in its entirety, as follows: 
"issue any Equity Securities that have rights, preferences or privileges with respect to Distributions, senior to the rights of the Class A-1 Preferred Shares in Sections 3.01(b)(i) or 3.02(a)(i) ("Senior Securities"); provided, that this Section 6.13(c) will not apply to the first $1,350,000,000 of new Senior Securities issued after the occurrence of Commercial Deployment (with such amount being calculated based on the consideration paid by the recipient(s) of such Senior Securities);". 
(e) 
Pursuant to the SoftBank Purchase Agreement and the IPMA, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, on the Original Closing Date GM (i) made, (A) a Capital Contribution totaling $1,100,000,000 in the aggregate and (B) a contribution of the Transferred Entities (as defined in the SoftBank Purchase Agreement) pursuant to the Restructuring (as defined in the SoftBank Purchase Agreement) and (ii) granted certain rights to the Company under the IPMA (together with the contributions in clause (i), the "GM Commitment"), in exchange for which the Company issued to GM 1,100,000 Class A-2 Preferred Shares and 5,500,000 Class C Common Shares. 

(f) 
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the consummation of the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment, the Company shall deliver to Honda an updated Members Schedule. 

2.03 Class B Common Shares.

Awards of Class B Common Shares ("Share Awards"), options to purchase Class B Common Shares ("Options") and rights to receive Class B Common Shares ("RSUs", and collectively with Share Awards and Options, "Equity Awards") may be granted or issued, as applicable, on or after the Original Closing Date to Employee Members pursuant to the terms of a Share Grant Agreement and in accordance with the 2018/2019 Incentive Plan or any successor employee incentive plan. 

(b) 
With respect to Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019, the Company may grant or issue to Employee Members (pursuant to Share Grant Agreements) Equity Awards that may be issued, exercised or settled into, in the aggregate, up to that maximum number of Class B Common Shares set forth in the 2018/2019 Incentive Plan. From and after Fiscal Year 2020, the Company (acting upon the approval of the Board of Directors) may issue additional Equity Awards to Employee Members. 

(c) 
The Board of Directors shall have the authority to determine the terms and conditions of the Share Grant Agreement to be executed by any Employee Members in connection with the grant of Equity Awards to such Employee Members (including terms and conditions relating to vesting, forfeiture, options to purchase and/or sell Class B Common Shares upon termination of employment and purchase prices and terms of any purchase and/or sale with respect thereto). 


(d) Each Share Grant Agreement with respect to Equity Awards is intended to 
10 
qualify as a compensatory benefit plan within the meaning of Rule 701 of the Securities Act and the issuance of Class B Common Shares, from time to time, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Share Grant Agreement is intended to qualify for the exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 701 thereof; provided, that, subject to Section 2.03(b), the foregoing shall not restrict or limit the Company's ability to issue any Class B Common Shares pursuant to any other exemption from registration under the Securities Act available to the Company and to designate any such issuance as not being subject to Rule 701. 
(e) Subject, in each case, to the terms and conditions of the applicable Share Grant Agreement: 
(i) 
Class B Common Shares that would be issued as a result of the exercise of a right to purchase pursuant to an issued Option shall be deemed, prior to their actual issuance, to be issued unvested Class B Common Shares for the purposes of Section 3.01(b)(ii) (and the holder of the Option shall be deemed a Class B Member solely for such purpose); provided, that, for clarity, no Distributions will actually be made with respect to such deemed unvested Class B Common Shares and Section 3.03 will not apply to such deemed unvested Class B Common Shares; and 

(ii) 
Class B Common Shares that would be issued as a result of the right to receive such Shares pursuant to an RSU shall be deemed, prior to their actual issuance, to be issued unvested Class B Common Shares for the purposes of Sections 3.01(b)(ii) and 3.01(b)(iii) (and the holder of the RSU shall be deemed a Class B Member solely for such purposes) and Section 3.03. 


2.04 Class E Common Shares. Pursuant to the Honda Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Honda has committed to make, and substantially concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Honda has made Capital Contributions totaling $750,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Honda Commitment"), pursuant to which the Company has issued to Honda 495,000 Class E Common Shares. 
2.05 Other Contributions. No Member shall be required to make any contributions to the Company other than the Capital Contributions as provided in this Article II or as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. Subject to Section 2.07, the Company shall not accept any Capital Contributions, other than Capital Contributions in respect of the Commitments, from a Member or any other Person unless the terms and conditions of any such Capital Contribution and related issuance of Shares have been approved by the Board of Directors. 
2.06 Issuances of Shares. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including Section 2.02, Section 2.07 and Section 6.13), the Board of Directors shall have sole and complete discretion in determining whether to issue any Equity Securities, the number and type of Equity Securities to be issued (including the creation of new series or classes of Shares) at any particular time and all other terms and conditions governing any such Equity Securities (including the issuance thereof); provided, that (a) the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment shall be on the terms set forth in this Agreement and shall not require any additional approval of the Board of Directors and (b) the Company shall not issue any Equity Securities 
11 
(whether denominated as Shares or otherwise) to any Person unless such Person shall have agreed to be bound by this Agreement and shall have executed such documents or instruments as the Board of Directors determines to be necessary or appropriate to effect such Person's admission as a Member. 
2.07 Preemptive Rights. 
(a) 
Except as provided in Section 2.07(e) or Section 2.07(f), if the Company wishes to issue any Equity Securities to any Person or Persons (all such Equity Securities, collectively, the "New Securities"), then the Company shall promptly deliver a written notice of intention to sell (the "Company's Notice of Intention to Sell") to each holder of Preemptive Shares setting forth a description of the New Securities to be sold, the proposed purchase price, the aggregate number of New Securities to be sold and the terms and conditions of sale. Upon receipt of the Company's Notice of Intention to Sell, each holder of Preemptive Shares shall have the right, during the Acceptance Period, to elect to purchase, at the price and on the terms and conditions stated in the Company's Notice of Intention to Sell, up to the number of New Securities equal to the product of (i) such holder's Preemptive Proportion, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of New Securities to be issued; provided, that if the New Securities consist of more than one class, series or type of Equity Securities, then any holder of Preemptive Shares who elects to purchase such New Securities pursuant to this Section 2.07 must purchase the same proportionate mix of all of such securities; provided, further, that if the New Securities are issued in connection with any debt financing undertaken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and to which preemptive rights otherwise apply pursuant to this Section 2.07, then any Class A-1 Member, Class D Member or Class E Member who elects to purchase such New Securities pursuant to this Section 2.07 must, to be eligible to receive such New Securities, participate in the underlying debt instrument for such financing (A) with and on the same terms as the other lenders thereunder and (B) in the same percentage as their Preemptive Proportion of New Securities that such Member wishes to purchase pursuant to this Section 2.07. If one or more holders of Preemptive Shares do not elect to purchase their entire share of the New Securities (such aggregate portion of New Securities that has not been so elected, the "Excess New Securities"), then the Company will offer, by written notice (the "Supplemental Notice of Intention to Sell"), to each holder of Preemptive Shares who has elected to purchase his, her or its entire proportion of the New Securities pursuant to this Section 2.07 the right to elect to purchase, at the price and on the terms and conditions stated in the Company's Notice of Intention to Sell, their Preemptive Proportion (calculated as if the Total Conversion Shares excludes all Shares of each holder of Preemptive Shares that did not elect to purchase their entire share of the New Securities) of the Excess New Securities such that all of the Excess New Securities may be purchased by such holders, if so elected. All elections under this Section 2.07(a) must be made by written notice to the Company within fifteen (15) days (or such later date determined by the Board of Directors) after receipt by such holder of Preemptive Shares of (as applicable) the Company's Notice of Intention to Sell or the Supplemental Notice of Intention to Sell (the "Acceptance Period"). 

(b) 
If the holders of Preemptive Shares have not elected to purchase all of the New Securities described in a Company's Notice of Intention to Sell, then the Company may, at its election, during the period of ninety (90) days immediately following the expiration of the Acceptance Period therefor (or the expiration of the Acceptance Period relating to the Supplemental 

(c) 
In the event the Company has not sold the New Securities to be issued within such ninety (90) day period, the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any such New Securities without once again offering such securities to each holder of Preemptive Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.07(a). 

(d) 
If a holder of Preemptive Shares elects to purchase any of the New Securities, payment therefor shall be made by wire transfer against delivery of such New Securities at the principal office of the Company within fifteen (15) days of such election unless a later date is mutually agreed between the Company and such holder of Preemptive Shares; provided, that if SoftBank elects to purchase any of the New Securities, to the extent necessary in order to accommodate the time required to call capital to purchase the Preemptive Shares, payment therefor shall be made by wire transfer against delivery of such New Securities at the principal office of the Company within thirty five (35) days of such election by SoftBank. 

(e) 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) no holder of Preemptive Shares shall have a right to purchase New Securities pursuant to this Section 2.07, if such purchase will, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors, violate any applicable laws (whether or not such violation may be cured by a filing of a registration statement or any other special disclosure) and (ii) in lieu of offering any New Securities to any holder of Preemptive Shares prior to the time such New Securities are offered or sold to any other Person or Persons, the Company may comply with the provisions of this Section 2.07 by first issuing New Securities to such other Person or Persons, and promptly after such issuance (or acceptance) (and, in any event, within thirty (30) days thereafter) making an offer to sell (or causing such other Person or Persons to offer to sell), to the holders of Preemptive Shares, New Securities in such a manner so as to enable such holders of Preemptive Shares to effectively exercise their respective rights pursuant to Section 2.07(a) with respect to their purchase, for cash, of such New Securities as they would have been entitled to purchase pursuant to Section 2.07(a). 

(f) 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.07, the preemptive rights contained in this Section 2.07 shall not apply to: 

(i) 
any Equity Securities issued pursuant to the funding of the GM Commitment, the SoftBank Commitment and the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment; 


12 
(ii) any Equity Securities issued pursuant to Sections 2.10 or 2.11; 
(iii) any Class B Common Shares that may be issued to Employee Members, including upon the exercise or settlement of any Equity Award; 
(iv) 
any Equity Securities issued in connection with an IPO (including pursuant to Section 9.10(c)); and 

(v) 
any Equity Securities issued upon any subdivision, split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or similar reorganization. 


13 
2.08 Certificates. The Company may, but shall not be required to, issue certificates representing Shares ("Certificated Shares"). 
2.09 Repurchase Rights. If an Employee Member ceases to be employed by or provide services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason, then the Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) to repurchase all or any portion of the Class B Common Shares held by such Employee Member and his or her Permitted Transferees and not otherwise forfeited (pursuant to this Agreement, the relevant employee incentive plan in place at the time or the applicable Share Grant Agreement or other agreement (or agreements) with the Company) at a price per Class B Common Share specified by, on the timeline provided by, and otherwise on the terms and conditions contained within, a Share Grant Agreement or other agreement (or agreements) between an Employee Member and the Company. 
2.10 Optional A-1 Conversion. 
(a) 
Each Class A-1 Preferred Member shall have the right, at such Member's option, at any time and from time to time to convert all or any portion of the Class A-1 Preferred Shares held by such Member into Class D Common Shares by providing the Company with written notice of such conversion. A conversion of Class A-1 Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) shall be effective as of the close of business on the first (1st) Business Day after the Company's receipt of the conversion notice. 

(b) 
In connection with any conversion pursuant to Section 2.10(a), (i) each Class A-1-A Preferred Share will be converted into Class D Common Shares at the A-1-A Preferred Share Conversion Ratio and (ii) each Class A-1-B Preferred Share will be converted into Class D Common Shares at the A-1-B Preferred Share Conversion Ratio. 

(c) 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Class A-1 Preferred Share that has been converted into a Class D Common Share under this Section 2.10 shall cease to have the rights, preferences and privileges provided under this Agreement for the Class A-1 Preferred Shares and shall thereafter be treated as a Class D Common Share for all purposes. 

2.11 Optional A-2 Conversion. 

(a) 
Each Class A-2 Preferred Member shall have the right, at such Member's option, at any time and from time to time, to convert all or any portion of the Class A-2 Preferred Shares held by such Member into Class C Common Shares, at a 1:1 ratio (as adjusted to reflect appropriate and proportional adjustments to take into account any subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of shares or similar event) by providing the Company with written notice of such conversion. A conversion of Class A-2 Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be effective as of the close of business on the first (1st) Business Day after the Company's receipt of the conversion notice. 

(b) 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Class A-2 Preferred Share that has been converted into a Class C Common Share under this Section 2.11 shall cease to have the rights, preferences and privileges provided under this Agreement for the Class A-2 Preferred Shares and shall thereafter be treated as a Class C Common Share for all purposes.

ARTICLE III DISTRIBUTIONS 
3.01 Distributions. 
(a) 
Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, all Distributions shall be made to the Persons who are the holders of Shares at the time such Distributions are made. 

(b) 
Subject to Section 3.02 and Section 3.03, and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.01, Distributions pursuant to this Article III shall be made Quarterly in arrears (on the final day of each Quarter) in the following order of priority: 

(i) 
First, Distributions shall be made to the Class A-1 Preferred Members in respect of their Class A-1 Preferred Shares (ratably among such Members based upon, for the relevant Quarter, the aggregate Class A-1 Preferred Return with respect to the Class A-1 Preferred Shares held by each such Member immediately prior to such Distribution) until each Class A-1 Preferred Member has received Distributions in respect of such Member's Class A-1 Preferred Shares in an amount equal to the aggregate Class A-1 Preferred Return for such Quarter (and not, for clarity, the full Class A-1 Preferred Unpaid Return) with respect to the Class A-1 Preferred Shares held by such Class A-1 Preferred Member immediately prior to such Distribution. The Company may, at its option, with respect to all or any portion of the Distributions on the Class A-1-A Preferred Shares and Class A­1-B Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 3.01(b)(i) for any Quarter, elect to pay such Distribution in (i) cash or (ii) by the accretion (with respect to such Quarter) of the Class A-1 Preferred Return on such Shares (which such accretion in the Class A-1 Preferred Return, and resultant increase in the Class A-1 Preferred Unpaid Return for such Shares, shall constitute a Distribution hereunder). 

(ii) 
Second, Distributions shall be made to the Junior Members until the cumulative amount received in cash by each of the Members pursuant to this Section 3.01(b)(ii) and Section 3.01(b)(i) with respect to all such Distributions made after the date of this Agreement to the relevant calculation date (including, for clarity, any Distributions made in such applicable Quarter pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i)), equals the amount such Member would have received if all such Distributions had been distributed ratably on an as-converted basis (for the purpose of such calculation with the Class A-1 Preferred Shares being deemed converted to Class D Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.10(b)) among such Members based upon the number of Junior Interests held by each such Junior Member and the number of Class A-1 Preferred Shares held by each such Class A-1 Preferred Member, in each case, immediately prior to such Distribution. For the avoidance of doubt, the Class A-1 Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any Distributions pursuant to this Section 3.01(b)(ii). 


15 
(iii) Third, all further Distributions shall be made to each Junior Member and Class A-1 Preferred Member ratably on an as-converted basis among such Members based upon the number of Junior Interests held by each such Junior Member and the number of Class A-1 Preferred Shares held by each such Class A-1 Preferred Member, in each case, immediately prior to such Distribution; provided, that, for the purposes of this Section 3.01(b)(iii), the Class A-1 Preferred Shares shall be deemed converted to Class D Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.10(b) without (for the purposes of calculating such conversion) any reduction in the Class A-1-A Preferred Unpaid Return or Class A-1-B Preferred Unpaid Return due to Distributions for such Quarter made pursuant to this Section 3.01(b)(iii). 
(c) 
No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the end of each Quarter, the Company will send written notice to each Class A-1 Preferred Member stating whether the Distribution pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i) for such Quarter will be paid in cash. If the Company fails to timely send such written notice then, with respect to such Quarter, the Company will be deemed to have irrevocably elected to pay the Distribution pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i) by the accretion of the Class A-1 Preferred Return. For clarity, (i) the Company may elect, independently as to each class, to pay cash Distributions with respect to a Quarter on either, or both, of the Class A-1-A Preferred Shares and Class A-1-B Preferred Shares and (ii) so long as the full Distribution has been made on each Class A-1 Preferred Share pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i), the Company may (but shall not be required to) make Distributions pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(ii) and Section 3.01(b)(iii). 

(d) 
No distributions shall be made in respect of a Vested Class B Common Share pursuant to Section 3.01(b) (ii), Section 3.01(b)(iii) or Section 3.02(a)(iii), until such time that an aggregate amount of Distributions (since the date of grant of such Class B Common Share) pursuant to Section 3.01(b) or 3.02(a), as applicable, equal to the Class B Floor Amount shall have been Distributed on each Class C Common Share. For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of any Class B Common Share will later have the right to receive any amount foregone pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 3.01(d). 

(e) 
Any reference in this agreement to a Distribution to a Substituted Member shall include any Distributions previously made to the predecessor Member on account of the interest of such predecessor Member transferred to such Substituted Member. 

(f) 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement the Company shall not make any Distribution to Members if such Distribution would violate Section 18-607 of the Act or other applicable law. 

3.02 Distributions Upon Liquidation or a Deemed Liquidation Event. 

(a) 
Notwithstanding Section 3.01, upon a liquidation (pursuant to Article X) or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Company shall distribute the net proceeds or assets available for distribution, whether in cash or in other property, to the Members as follows: 

(i) 
First, Class A-1 Preferred Members shall receive, on a pro rata basis (proportional to their share of the aggregate Class A-1 Liquidation Preference Amount for all 

(ii) 
Second, Class A-2 Preferred Members shall receive, for each Class A-2 Preferred Share, the greater of (A) the Class A-2 Liquidation Preference Amount and (B) the amount distributable pursuant to Section 3.02(a)(iii) with respect to such Class A-2 Preferred Share as if such Share had converted into a Class C Common Share (pursuant to Section 2.11) immediately prior to the event giving rise to a Distribution pursuant to this Section 3.02. 


16 
(iii) Third, to Junior Members (other than the Class A-2 Preferred Members), ratably among such Members based upon the number of Junior Interests held by each such Junior Member (other than Class A-2 Preferred Shares). 
(b) A "Deemed Liquidation Event" shall occur upon either of a Sale of the Company or a Drag-Along Sale Transaction. 
3.03 Unvested Class B Common Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) no Distribution shall be made in respect of any Class B Common Share that is not a Vested Class B Common Share, (b) any amount that would otherwise be distributable in cash in respect of a Class B Common Share pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.02 but for the fact that such Class B Common Share is not a Vested Class B Common Share shall be withheld by the Company and Distributed with respect to such Class B Common Share, without interest, at the time of the first cash Distribution to the Junior Members following the date on which such Class B Common Share becomes a Vested Class B Common Share and (c) if a Class B Common Share that is not a Vested Class B Common Share is repurchased or forfeited (or otherwise becomes incapable of vesting), then such Class B Common Share shall not be entitled to receive or retain any Distributions. 
3.04 
Distributions In-Kind. Distributions of property other than cash, including securities (but, for the avoidance of doubt, Distributions in respect of the Class A-1 Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i) shall not include stock or securities issued by the Company and may only be made in cash or accretion pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(i)), may be made under this Agreement with the approval of the Board of Directors. Distributions of property other than cash shall be valued at Fair Market Value. Except as otherwise required by the Act or this Agreement, and subject in all respects to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, no Member shall be entitled to Distributions of property other than cash and the Board of Directors may make a determination to distribute property to one Member or group of Members and cash to the remaining Members so long as no Member is adversely affected in a manner which is disproportionate to the other Members as a result of such determination. 

4.01 
Corporate Status. The Members intend that the Company be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal, and, as applicable, state and local, income tax purposes, and neither the Company nor any of the Members shall take any reporting position inconsistent with such treatment. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company has elected, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c), to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation, effective as of May 23, 2018. The Company will not make any other entity classification elections with respect to the Company without the prior written consent of all Members; provided that an entity classification may be made to treat the Entity as an association taxable as a corporation without any such consent. 


17 
4.02 Withholding. The Company is authorized to withhold from any payment made to a Member any amounts required to be withheld by the Company under applicable law and, if so required, remit any such amounts to the applicable governmental authority. Upon request by the Company in writing, each Member shall provide the Company with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9 or applicable IRS Form W-8, or any other information, form or certificate reasonably necessary to determine whether and the extent to which any such withholding is required. If the Company, or the Board of Directors or any Affiliate of the Company, becomes liable as a result of a failure to withhold and remit taxes in respect of any Member and such failure was attributable to such Member's failure to timely provide the Company with the appropriate information requested in writing by the Company regarding such Member's tax status or tax payment obligations, then such Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, or the Board of Directors or any Affiliate of the Company, as the case may be, in respect of any such tax that should have been withheld and remitted (including any interest or penalties assessed or imposed thereon and any expenses incurred in any examination, determination, resolution and payment of such tax) but was not so withheld and remitted as a result of such Member's failure to timely provide the Company with such information. The provisions contained in this Section 4.02 shall survive the termination of the Company and the withdrawal of any Member. 
4.03 Tax Sharing. 
(a) 
GM Consolidated Group. For the 2018 Tax Period of the GM Consolidated Group, the Company shall timely deliver to GM Parent a properly completed and duly executed IRS Form 1122 (Authorization and Consent of Subsidiary Corporation To Be Included in a Consolidated Income Tax Return) and any similar or corresponding forms required for state or local income or franchise tax purposes. The Company acknowledges and agrees that GM Parent shall act as sole agent (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-77) for the Company with respect to any Tax Period for which the Company joins one or more members of the GM Consolidated Group in filing a GM Consolidated Return, provided that the GM Investor shall cause GM Parent to not take any action with respect to any tax matters, including any action in its role as sole agent (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-77) that has a material and disproportionate adverse impact on (i) the Company (ii) prior to the one-time Transfer permitted by Section 9.02(c), SoftBank or (iii) after the one-time Transfer permitted by Section 9.02(c), SVFA, 

(b) Payment from the GM Investor to the Company for Use of Company NOLs and Tax Credits. 

(i) 
If upon a Deconsolidation the NOL Deficit Amount exceeds zero, the GM Investor shall pay to the Company, with respect to each Tax Period of the Company, the Excess NOL Tax Increase with respect to such Tax Period. The GM Investor shall pay the Excess NOL Tax Increase with respect to each such Tax Period no later than ten (10) Business Days following delivery of written notice by the Company to the GM Investor of the amount of Excess NOL Tax Increase for such Tax Period. 

(ii) 
In addition to the payments described in Section 4.03(b)(i) above (and without duplication of such payments or any other payments required to be made by the GM Investor hereunder), the GM Investor shall make payments to the Company with respect to any R&D Tax Credits or Other Tax Credits generated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the same manner and using the same principles as described in Section 4.03(b)(i) and in the definitions of NOL Deficit Amount and Hypothetical Deconsolidated Company NOL Amount; provided, however, that in applying such principles, (A) clause (ii) of the definition of NOL Deficit Amount shall not apply and (B) in applying the Company standalone concept of the Hypothetical Deconsolidated Company NOL Amount, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be assumed to utilize the same tax accounting methods, elections, conventions, practices, policies and principles regarding the R&D Tax Credits or Other Tax Credits actually utilized by the GM Consolidated Group and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall otherwise be assumed to take into account the GM Consolidated Group's history in its use of R&D Tax Credits or Other Tax Credits; provided, further, that no such payment with respect to Other Tax Credits will be required unless and until such Other Tax Credits generated by the Company and its Subsidiaries exceed, in the aggregate, taking into account any Other Tax Credits referenced in Section 4.03(e), $12,000,000 with respect to any calendar year. 


18 
(iii) The GM Investor and its advisors shall calculate the NOL Deficit Amount and the deficit amount in respect of R&D Tax Credits and Other Tax Credits upon a Deconsolidation and shall deliver such calculations, certified by the chief tax officer of GM Parent, to the Company and, subject to Section 4.03(f), such calculations shall be conclusive, binding and final for all purposes. The Company shall calculate the Excess NOL Tax Increase and the tax increase in respect of R&D Tax Credits and Other Tax Credits in each Tax Period and shall deliver such calculations, certified by the chief tax officer of the Company, along with reasonably detailed supporting documentation, to the GM Investor and, subject to Section 4.03(f), such calculation shall be conclusive, binding and final for all purposes. 
19 
(c) Payment from the Company to the GM Investor for Inclusion of Company Income. 
(i) 
Following the filing of the final GM Consolidated Return for each Tax Period prior to a Deconsolidation, the Company shall calculate the Aggregate Company Hypothetical Pre-Deconsolidation Tax Amount with respect to such Tax Period. 

(ii) 
Following the filing of the final GM Consolidated Return for each Tax Period ending after the Original Closing Date, the GM Investor shall calculate the Incremental GM Tax Amount. The GM Investor shall deliver to the Company a certification by the chief tax officer of GM Parent with respect to such amount and such calculation shall be conclusive, binding and final for all purposes. No certification shall be required in any year in which the GM Investor has determined that the Incremental GM Tax Amount is zero. 


(iii) With respect to each Tax Period of the GM Consolidated Group ending after the Original Closing Date, the Company shall make a payment to the GM Investor equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the lesser of (1) the Aggregate Company Hypothetical Pre-Deconsolidation Tax Amount with respect to such Tax Period and (2) the Incremental GM Tax Amount with respect to such Tax Period over (B) the aggregate net payment made by the Company to the GM Investor pursuant to this Section 4.03(c)(iii) and Section 4.03(c)(iv) for prior Tax Periods. 
(iv) 
With respect to each Tax Period of the GM Consolidated Group ending after the Original Closing Date, the GM Investor shall make a payment to the Company equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the aggregate net payment made by the Company to the GM Investor pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii) and this Section 4.03(c)(iv) for prior Tax Periods over (B) the lesser of (1) the Aggregate Company Hypothetical Pre-Deconsolidation Tax Amount with respect to such Tax Period and (2) the Incremental GM Tax Amount with respect to such Tax Period; 

(d) 
Payments between GM Investor and the Company if a Section 59(e) Election is Made. If prior to a Deconsolidation, GM makes one or more elections under Section 59(e) of the Code (a "Section 59(e) Election") with respect to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, then: 

(i) 
with respect to each Tax Period for which a Section 59(e) Election is made, and any subsequent Tax Period, any payment otherwise required to be made by the Company to the GM Investor pursuant to Section 4.03(c) shall be 

(A)
 reduced (but not below zero) by the Section 59(e) Detriment Amount with respect to such Tax Period and (B) shall be increased by the Section 59(e) Benefit Amount with respect to such Tax Period; provided, any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.03(d)(i) 

(B) 
shall be deferred and shall only be made when and to the extent that, immediately prior to giving effect to such adjustment, the aggregate adjustments under Section 4.03(d)(i)(A) and Section 4.03(d)(ii)(A) exceed the aggregate adjustments under this Section 4.03(d)(i)(B) and Section 4.03(d)(ii)(B); and 

(ii) 
with respect to each Tax Period for which a Section 59(e) Election is made, and any subsequent Tax Period, any payment otherwise required to be made by the GM Investor to the Company pursuant to Section 4.03(b) shall be 

(A)
 increased by the Section 59(e) Detriment Amount with respect to such Tax Period and shall be (B) reduced (but not below zero) 


20 
by the Section 59(e) Benefit Amount with respect to such Tax Period; provided, any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.03(d)(ii)

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of Sections 4.03(d)(i) and (ii) above, a required payment of $0 under Section 4.03(b) or Section 4.03(c) for any Tax Period constitutes a "payment otherwise required to be made".

The GM Investor and the Company may make written submissions to the Accounting Firm, and the Accounting Firm's resolution shall be based solely upon the actual terms of this Agreement, the written submissions of the GM Investor and the Company, and the application of federal income tax law (or, in the case of any payment obligation Section 4.03(e), applicable state or local income tax law). Each of the GM Investor and the Company shall be bound by the determination of the Accounting Firm and shall bear one-half of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. 

(g)

(k) 
Consistent Reporting Covenant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Class A Preferred Shares are intended to be treated as common stock for all purposes of the Code (and not as preferred stock within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.305-5). Absent a relevant change in law or administrative, regulatory or judicial authority or guidance, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, neither the Company nor any of the Members shall report any Distribution with respect to the Class A Preferred Shares that is paid by accretion of the Class A-1 Preferred Return on such Shares (in accordance with Section 3.01(c) hereof) as a taxable distribution pursuant to Section 305(b)(2) of the Code or take any position inconsistent with the intended tax treatment described in this Section 4.03(k). 

(l) 
Audit Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event there is an adjustment to any GM Consolidated Return or any Company tax return for any Tax Period as a result of an audit, the computations described in this Section 4.03 will be adjusted to reflect the results of such audit and any amounts payable hereunder shall be increased or decreased to reflect the revised computations.

Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular meeting of Members need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

(i) 
the Directors shall not have, or be deemed to have, any duties or implied duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company or its Subsidiaries, any Member or any other Person (and each Director may act in and consider the best interests of the Member who designated such Director and shall not be required to act in or consider the best interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the other Members) and any duties or implied duties (including fiduciary duties) of a Director to any other Member or the Company or its Subsidiaries that would otherwise apply at law or in equity are hereby disclaimed and eliminated to the fullest extent permitted under the Act and any other applicable law, and each Member hereby disclaims and waives all rights to, and releases each other Member and each Director from, any such duties, in each case with respect to or in connection with any of the following circumstances:

Without Honda's prior written consent, for so long as Honda owns the Honda Floor Amount, the Company shall not make any alteration or amendment or waiver to this Agreement that would have a material and disproportionate adverse effect on the terms of the Class E Common Shares; provided, that this Section 5.12 will not apply to any of the following: (i) the addition of Members to the Company or the issuance of Shares or other Equity Securities of the Company (whether of a new or an existing class), in each case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and any amendment(s) to this Agreement in connection with implementing such issuance or addition of such Member(s) (including the updating of the Members Schedule in connection therewith) or the granting of any rights to one or more Members in connection with such issuance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) any amendment(s) to this Agreement in connection with the preparation for or consummation of an IPO that do not have a material and disproportionate effect on the terms of the Class E Common Shares (except as contemplated by Section 9.10) or (iii) to correct any typographical or similar ministerial errors. In determining whether an amendment has a material and disproportionate adverse effect on the terms of the Class E Common Shares, only the terms related thereto shall be considered, and any other relationship(s) the Class E Members may have with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the other Members shall not be considered and no characteristic of the Class E Members other than the terms of the Class E Common Shares shall be considered.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein (or if required by a non-waivable provision of the Act), no Member shall have the right to manage the Company or to reject, override, overturn, veto or otherwise approve or pass judgement upon any action taken by the Board of Directors or an 

(b) 
Each Director shall constitute a "manager" within the meaning of the Act. However, no individual Director, in his or her capacity as such, shall have the authority to bind the Company.

6.03 Board Designation Rights and Composition; Proxies. 
(a) (i) The Class A-2 Preferred Members shall, by vote of a Majority of the Class A-2 Preferred, have the exclusive right to designate, appoint, remove and replace all Directors (including any Director vacancies created by virtue of an increase in the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 6.02) other than the SoftBank Director (if applicable) and the Common Director (the "A-2 Preferred Directors"); provided, that if there are no Class A-2 Preferred Shares outstanding, the A-2 Preferred Directors will be appointed by a Majority of the Class C Common, (ii) the Members holding Common Shares shall, by vote of a Majority of the Common Shares, have the exclusive right to designate, appoint, remove and replace one (1) Director (the "Common Director"), and (iii) following the receipt of SoftBank CFIUS Approval and subject to Section 6.05, SoftBank shall have the exclusive right (exercisable by written notification to the Company and the GM Investor), for so long as SoftBank owns the SoftBank Floor Amount, to designate, appoint, remove and replace one (1) Director (the "SoftBank Director").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such time as SoftBank owns less than the SoftBank Floor Amount, the SoftBank Director shall be immediately and automatically removed, 
30 
and the right of SoftBank to designate, appoint, remove and replace a Director shall be null and void and, for clarity, Class A-2 Preferred Members shall, by vote of a Majority of the Class A-2 Preferred (or a Majority of the Class C Common, if no Class A-2 Preferred Shares are outstanding), have the exclusive right to fill such vacant Director position (and, thereafter, designate, appoint, remove and replace such Director). Except as otherwise expressly stated herein, this Section 6.03 is the exclusive means by which Directors may be removed or replaced. 
(b) 
The GM Investor may elect any one (1) of the Directors to be the Chairman of the Board of Directors (the "Chairman"). The Chairman, if any, may be removed from his or her position as Chairman at any time by the GM Investor.

The Chairman shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and at all meetings of the Members at which he or she shall be present. The Chairman may be the chief executive officer, or have another officer position, at GM (or any of its Affiliates) or the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries). 

(c) 
To the extent permitted by law, each Member shall vote all voting securities of the Company over which such Member has voting control, and shall take all other necessary or desirable actions within such Member's control (whether in such Member's capacity as a Member, Director, member of a board committee or Officer of the Company or otherwise, and including attendance at meetings in person or by proxy for purposes of obtaining a quorum and execution of written consents in lieu of meetings), and the Company shall take all necessary and desirable actions within its control (including calling special Board of Directors or member meetings), so that the provisions of this Section 6.03 are promptly complied with and that the composition of the Board of Directors is consistent with the terms and conditions of this Section 6.03. 

(d) 
Any A-2 Preferred Director or Common Director may authorize any other Director to act for such Director by proxy on any matter brought before the Board of Directors for a vote, which proxy may be granted orally or in writing by the applicable Director. Any such proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Director granting it, provided that such right to revocation shall not invalidate or otherwise affect actions taken under such proxy prior to such revocation. 


6.04 Board Observer. Following the receipt of SoftBank CFIUS Approval and subject to Section 6.05, SoftBank shall have the exclusive right, for so long as SoftBank owns the SoftBank Floor Amount, to designate one natural person to attend all meetings of the Board of Directors in a non-voting observer capacity (the "SoftBank Board Observer"). Following the receipt of Honda CFIUS Approval and subject to Section 6.05, Honda shall have the exclusive right, for so long as Honda owns the Honda Floor Amount, to designate one natural person to attend all meetings of the Board of Directors in a non-voting observer capacity (the "Honda Board Observer", and together with the SoftBank Board Observer, the "Board Observers"). The following terms and conditions will apply to the Board Observers: 
(a)

Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and GM or any of its Affiliates on the other hand, except in each case for any such transaction, arrangement or agreement, (i) on terms, as determined by the Board of Directors acting in good faith, that are no less favorable, in all material respects, than those the Company would agree to with any Person who is not GM or any of its Affiliates; provided, that for any such transaction, arrangement or agreement, the Board of Directors may (but shall not be obligated to) obtain (A) an opinion of an independent auditor or independent outside counsel that the requirements of subsection (i) have been satisfied or (B) approval of a majority of the Independent Directors (to the extent any are appointed), and such opinion or approval shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of subsection (i) have been satisfied and shall be binding on the Members (it being understood that failure to obtain such opinion or approval shall not, in and of itself, be evidence that the requirements of subsection 
(i) 
have not been satisfied); (ii) contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the Commercial Agreements (as the same may be amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions thereof), or which is otherwise on terms consistent with the Commercial Agreements; or (iii) providing for the issuance of Equity Securities pursuant to Section 2.06;

(i) 
the Board of Directors, at or prior to the consummation of such an IPO (other than an IPO with no primary issuance or that constitutes a spin-off), causes the Company to make an irrevocable written commitment to each Class A-1 Preferred Member pursuant to which the Company will provide to such Class A-1 Preferred Member additional Low-Vote IPO Shares and/or cash equal to the aggregate IPO Shortfall that would be suffered by such Class A-1 Preferred Member; or 

(ii) 
in the case of such an IPO with no primary issuance or that constitutes a spin-off, at or prior to the consummation of such IPO the IPO'd entity enters into a binding agreement providing that, if based on the thirty (30)-day variable weighted average share price of the IPO'd entity immediately following such IPO there exists an IPO Shortfall, such entity will issue to the former Class A-1 Preferred Members additional Low-Vote IPO Shares and/or cash equal to the aggregate IPO Shortfall.

(iii) Sections 9.01(a)(i) and 9.01(a)(ii) (1) will not apply to any Transfer pursuant to Sections 2.02(c), 2.10, 9.02, 9.07, 9.08, 9.09, 9.10 or 9.12 (such Transfer, an "Excluded Transfer") and (2) will cease to apply upon consummation of an IPO. For clarity, except as set forth in Section 9.01(b), no Class A-2 Preferred Member or Class C Member is subject to any restrictions on Transfer of its Class A-2 Preferred Shares or Class C Common Shares. 
(iv) From and after the SoftBank Trigger Date, the limitations on Transfer set forth in Sections 9.01(a) 
(i) will cease to apply; provided, that following the SoftBank Trigger 
42 
Date and prior to the consummation of an IPO no Transfer of Class A-1 Preferred Shares, Class D Common Shares or any other Equity Securities held by SoftBank, SVFA or any of their Affiliates will be permitted unless the holder of such Shares shall have first complied with the provisions of Section 9.01(a)(v). From and after the Honda Trigger Date, the limitations on Transfer set forth in Section 9.01(a)(ii) will cease to apply; provided, that following the Honda Trigger Date, and prior to the consummation of an IPO no Transfer of Class E Common Shares or any other Equity Securities held by Honda or any of its Affiliates will be permitted unless the holder of such Shares shall have first complied with the provisions of Section 9.01(a)(v). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including the expiration of the limitations on Transfer set forth in Sections 9.01(a)(i) and 9.01(a)(ii) from and after the SoftBank Trigger Date or the Honda Trigger Date, as applicable, but prior to the consummation of the IPO), at no time may (a) Class A-1 Preferred Shares, Class D Common Shares or any other Equity Securities held by SoftBank or any of its Affiliates, be Transferred to a SoftBank Restricted Person without the prior written approval of each of the GM Investor and the Board of Directors or (b) Class E Common Shares or any other Equity Securities held by Honda or any of its Affiliates, be Transferred to a Honda Restricted Person without the prior written approval of each of the GM Investor and the Board of Directors. 
(v) 
At least fifteen (15) days (or such shorter period as may be consented to by the Board of Directors) prior to entering into any definitive agreement (a "Binding Transaction Agreement") providing for, or entered into in connection with, a proposed Transfer (other than an Excluded Transfer) of (A) Class A-1 Preferred Shares, Class D Common Shares or any other Equity Securities held by SoftBank, SVFA or any of their Affiliates, in each case from and after the SoftBank Trigger Date or 

(B) 
Class E Common Shares or any other Equity Securities held by Honda or any of their Affiliates from and after the Honda Trigger Date, such Member proposing to make such a Transfer (the "Transferor") shall deliver a written notice (the "ROFR Notice") to the Board of Directors and the GM Investor, specifying in reasonable detail the identity of the prospective transferee(s), the number and class of Shares or other Equity Securities proposed to be Transferred (the "ROFR Offered Shares") and the price and other terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer. No Transferor shall enter into a Binding Transaction Agreement or consummate such proposed Transfer before the GM ROFR Date (or such shorter period as consented to by the Board of Directors). Following receipt of the ROFR Notice, the GM Investor may elect to purchase all (but not less than all) of the ROFR Offered Shares at the price set forth in the ROFR Notice and otherwise on Equivalent Terms, by delivering (or one of its Affiliates delivering) written notice (a "GM ROFR Notice") of such election to the relevant Transferor(s) within ten (10) days after delivery of the ROFR Notice (such 10th day, the "GM ROFR Date"). If the GM Investor (or one of its Affiliates) does not deliver a GM ROFR Notice electing to purchase all of the ROFR Offered Shares at the price set forth in the ROFR Notice and otherwise on Equivalent Terms on or prior to the GM ROFR Date, then the applicable Transferor(s) may sell all, but not less than all, of the ROFR Offered Shares to the Person identified in the ROFR Notice for a per Share amount equal to or greater than, and on other terms no less favorable to Transferor than, the price and other terms set forth in the ROFR Notice, in each case within one hundred twenty (120) days following the GM ROFR Date. Any ROFR Offered Shares not Transferred within such one hundred twenty (120)-day period shall again be subject to the provisions of this Section 9.01(a)(v) prior to any subsequent Transfer. If the GM Investor has elected to purchase the ROFR Offered Shares in accordance with this Section 9.01(a)(v), then such purchase shall be consummated as soon as practicable after the delivery of the GM 


43 
ROFR Notice to the Transferor(s), but in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the delivery of such GM ROFR Notice. If the consideration proposed to be paid for the ROFR Offered Shares in the ROFR Notice is in property, services or other non-cash consideration, then the fair market value of such non-cash consideration shall be equal to the Fair Market Value thereof. The GM Investor shall pay the cash equivalent of such Fair Market Value of any such property, services or other non-cash consideration proposed to be paid in the ROFR Notice. 
(b) 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no Transfer of Shares may be made unless, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, satisfactory in form and substance to the Board of Directors (which opinion requirement, or one or more components thereof, may be waived, in whole or in part by the Board of Directors), such Transfer would not result in (i) a violation of any applicable United States federal or state securities laws, (ii) unless waived by the Board of Directors, the Company being required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or any other federal or state securities laws or (iii) other than pursuant to Section 9.10, the Company being required to register under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a condition to the Company recognizing the effectiveness of any Transfer of Shares, the Board of Directors may require the transferor and/or transferee, as the case may be, to execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company such instruments of transfer, assignment and assumption and such other certificates, representations and documents, and to perform all such other acts, which the Board of Directors may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to (A) verify the Transfer, (B) confirm that the proposed transferee has accepted, assumed and agreed to be subject and bound by all of the terms, obligations and conditions of this Agreement (whether or not such Person is to be admitted as a new Member) and (C) assure compliance with applicable state and federal laws, including securities laws and regulations. For the purposes of this Article IX, any transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or other direct or indirect disposition of shares or other interests of any Person which is an entity and a substantial portion of the assets of which are, directly or indirectly, Shares or other Equity Securities, or which is intentionally designed to, or has the effect of, circumventing the intention of the Transfer restrictions in this Agreement, shall be deemed to be a Transfer of Shares or Equity Securities (as applicable). Each Member as to which the immediately preceding sentence applies shall cause its direct and indirect interest holders to comply with the provisions of this Article IX. 

(c) 
No Transfer of Class A-1 Preferred Shares may be consummated (and any process pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(v) shall be suspended if a Call Notice is delivered pursuant to Section 9.12) until such time as the Class A-1/D Purchase pursuant to such Call Notice has been consummated. 

(d) 
Without prejudice to SoftBank's right to consummate the one-time Transfer as permitted by Section 9.02(c), until such time as SoftBank has paid, in full, the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment pursuant to Section 2.02(c), SoftBank (i) shall not make any Transfer if the effect of such Transfer would be that SoftBank ceases to be a Member hereunder and (ii) shall ensure that it has uncalled capital commitments sufficient to pay the Subsequent SoftBank Commitment in full. 


44 
9.02 Permitted Transfers. 
(a) 
Notwithstanding Section 9.01(a), Class A-1 Preferred Shares, Class D Common Shares, Class B Common Shares and Class E Common Shares may be Transferred by the holder thereof without obtaining the approval of the Board of Directors: (i) in the case of an Employee Member, to a member of the Family Group of the Person to whom such Shares were originally issued (a Transfer pursuant to this clause (i), an "Exempt Employee Member Transfer"), (ii) in the case of a Class A-1 Preferred Member or Class D Member, to an Affiliate (other than SoftBank Group Corp. or its Subsidiaries) of such Class A-1 Preferred Member or Class D Member that (A) is owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by such Class A-1 Preferred Member or such Class D Member, and (B) is not a SoftBank Restricted Person (a Transfer pursuant to this clause (ii), an "Exempt SoftBank Transfer") or (iii) in the case of a Class E Member, (A) to an Affiliate that is not a Honda Restricted Person or (B) subject to compliance with Section 9.01(a)(v), following the consummation of an OEM Restricted Investment, to a Person that is not a Honda Restricted Person (a Transfer pursuant to this clause (iii), an "Exempt Honda Transfer"); provided, that any Transfer by the Class E Member must be a Transfer of all of such Class E Member's equity interests in the Company and (subject only to Section 9.02(c)) the permitted exceptions in this Section 9.02(a) will not apply to any Shares held by SoftBank. If a Permitted Transferee ceases to meet the criteria set forth in (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence (as applicable), such Permitted Transferee shall re-transfer (within ten (10) Business Days) the Shares Transferred to such Permitted Transferee to the original transferor (in the case of an Exempt SoftBank Transfer or an Exempt Honda Transfer) or to another member of the Family Group of such transferring Person (in the case of an Exempt Employee Member Transfer) and, pending the completion of such re-transfer, such Permitted Transferee shall not have any rights under this Agreement in respect of such Shares held by him, her or it. 

(b) 
As used herein, a "Permitted Transferee" shall constitute any Person, other than the Company, to whom Shares are Transferred pursuant to this Section 9.02. 

(c) 
Notwithstanding Section 9.01(a), SoftBank may, on or prior to September 10, 2018, Transfer all, but not less than all, of its Shares as well as its corresponding rights and obligations under this Agreement (including those set forth in Sections 2.02(c)(i) and 9.01(d)) to SVF or a Sidecar Fund (the "SVF Transfer"). Any such Transfer consummated pursuant to and in compliance with this Section 9.02(c) will be deemed to have been approved by the Board of Directors. 

9.03 Assignee's Rights and Obligations. 

(a) 
A Transfer of a Share permitted pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective as of the date of assignment and compliance with the conditions to such Transfer, and such Transfer shall be shown on the books and records of the Company. Prior to the date that the Transfer is consummated and the transferee becomes a Member hereunder, such proposed transferee shall be referred to herein as an "Assignee". Distributions made before the effective date of such Transfer, shall be paid to the transferor, and Distributions made after such date shall be paid to the Assignee. 

(b) 
Unless and until an Assignee becomes a Member pursuant to this Article IX, the Assignee shall not be entitled to any of the rights granted to a Member hereunder or under applicable law, other than the rights granted specifically to Assignees pursuant to this Agreement and rights granted to Assignees pursuant to the Act. Further, such Assignee shall be bound by any limitations and obligations contained herein with respect to Members. 

(c) 
Any Member who shall Transfer any Shares or other interest in the Company shall cease to be a Member with respect to such Shares or other interest and shall no longer have any rights or privileges of a Member with respect to such Shares or other interest, except that, unless and until the Assignee is admitted as a Substituted Member in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.04 (the "Admission Date"), (i) such assigning Member shall retain all of the duties, liabilities and obligations of a Member with respect to such Shares or other interest and (ii) the Board of Directors may reinstate all or any portion of the rights and privileges of such Member with respect to such Shares or other interest for any period of time prior to the Admission Date. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any Member who Transfers any Shares or other interest in the Company from any liability of such Member to the Company or the other Members with respect to such Shares or other interest that may exist on the Admission Date or that is otherwise specified in the Act and incorporated into this Agreement or for any liability to the Company or any other Person for any breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants by such Member (in its capacity as such) contained herein or in the other agreements with the Company. 

(d) 
For clarity (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein), the respective rights of SoftBank and Honda hereunder are personal to SoftBank and Honda, as applicable, (for so long as SoftBank or Honda, as applicable, is a Member), do not attach to the Class A-1 Preferred Shares or Class E Common Shares, or any other class of Shares or Equity Interests, and cannot be assigned by SoftBank or Honda to any other Person, except in connection with an Exempt SoftBank Transfer, an Exempt Honda Transfer pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(iii)(A) (but not, for clarity, Section 9.02(a)(iii)(B)) or, in the case of SoftBank, connection with a Transfer made pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section 9.02(c). 

9.04 Admission of Members. 

(a) 
In connection with the Transfer of a Share of a Member permitted under the terms of this Agreement, the transferee shall not become a Member (a "Substituted Member") until the later of (i) the effective date of such Transfer and (ii) the date on which the Board of Directors approves such transferee as a Substituted Member (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and such admission shall be shown on the books and records of the Company 

(b) 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement, a Person may be admitted to the Company as a Member by the Board of Directors (an "Additional Member"). Such admission shall become effective on the date on which such admission is shown on the books and records of the Company. 


45 
9.05 Certain Requirements of Prospective Members. As a condition to admission to the Company as a Member, each Assignee and Additional Member shall execute and deliver a 
46 
9.06 Status of Transferred Shares. Shares that are Transferred shall thereafter continue to be subject to all restrictions and obligations imposed by this Agreement with respect to Shares and Transfers thereof. 
9.07 Tag-Along Rights. 
(a) 
If any Class A-2 Member or Class C Member (the "Transferring Holder") proposes to Transfer Class A­2 Preferred Shares or Class C Common Shares (or any other Equity Securities held by such Member) to an Independent Third Party prior to an IPO (other than any Transfer (i) as provided in Section 9.08, (ii) as provided in Section 9.09, (iii) in connection with Section 9.10 or (iv) as provided in Section 9.12), then the Transferring Holder(s) shall deliver a written notice (such notice, the "Tag Notice") to the Company, each Class D Member, each Class A-1 Preferred Member and each Class E Member (the "Participation Members") at least thirty (30) days prior to making such Transfer, specifying in reasonable detail the identity of the prospective transferee(s), the number of Class A-2 Preferred Shares or Class C Common Shares (or any other Equity Securities held by such Members) to be Transferred and the price and other terms and conditions of the Transfer. Each Participation Member may elect to participate in the contemplated Transfer in the manner set forth in this Section 9.07 by delivering an irrevocable written notice to the Transferring Holder(s) within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Tag Notice, which notice shall specify the number of Class A-1 Preferred Shares, Class D Common Shares and Class E Common Shares (or any other Equity Securities held by such Members) that such Participation Member desires to include in such proposed Transfer. If none of the Participation Members gives such notice prior to the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period for giving such notice, then the Transferring Holder(s) may Transfer such Class A-2 Preferred Shares or Class C Common Shares (or any other Equity Securities held by such Members) to any Person at the same price and on other terms and conditions that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the Transferring Holder(s) than those set forth in the Tag Notice. If any Participation Members have irrevocably elected to participate in such Transfer prior to the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period for giving notice, each Participation Member shall be entitled to sell in the contemplated Transfer a total number of Class A-1 Preferred Shares with respect to Class A-1 Preferred Members or Class E Common Shares with respect to Class E Members (the "Tagged Shares") to be sold in the Transfer, to be calculated according to the following methodology: 

(i) 
First, all Junior Interests owned by the Transferring Holder are deemed converted (on a Fully Diluted Basis) to Class D Common Shares on a 1:1 basis (as adjusted, as necessary, to reflect appropriate and proportional adjustments to take into account any subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of shares or similar event) and all Class A-1 Preferred Shares held by all Participation Member(s) are deemed converted to Class D Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.10(b) (collectively the number of Class D Common Shares resulting from the deemed conversion, plus the number of Class D Common Shares held by the Participating Members prior to such deemed conversion, the "Total Conversion Shares"). For clarity, such "deemed" conversion pursuant to this Section 9.07(a) shall 


47 
Shares").  (ii)  Second, the total number of Shares that are subject to Transfer is determined (the "Total Tagged  
(iii)  Third, the Tagged Shares will be:  
(A)  a number of Class A-1-A Preferred Shares equal to: (1) Total Tagged Shares multiplied by  

a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of Class D Common Shares into which the Class A-1-A Preferred Shares of such Participation Member were deemed converted pursuant to subsection (i) above, and (y) the denominator of which is the Total Conversion Shares divided by, (2) the A-1-A Preferred Share Conversion Ratio; 
(B) 
a number of Class A-1-B Preferred Shares equal to: (1) Total Tagged Shares multiplied by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number of Class D Common Shares into which the Class A-1-B Preferred Shares of such Participation Member were deemed converted pursuant to subsection (i) above, and (y) the denominator of which is the Total Conversion Shares divided by, (2) A-1-B Preferred Share Conversion Ratio; and 

(C) 
a number of Class D Common Shares equal to: Total Tagged Shares multiplied by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the number of Class D Common Shares held by the Participating Member prior to the deemed conversion pursuant to subsection (i) above, and (2) the denominator of which is the Total Conversion Shares. 

(D) 
a number of Class E Common Shares equal to: Total Tagged Shares multiplied by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the number of Class E Common Shares held by the Participating Member prior to the deemed conversion pursuant to subsection (i) above, and (2) the denominator of which is the Total Conversion Shares. 

(b) 
Immediately prior to the consummation of the Transfer to the Independent Third Party, the Tagged Shares (other than Class E Common Shares) will be automatically, and without any further action, be actually converted into Class D Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.10(b). The Transferring Holder(s) and each participating Participation Member shall receive the same form of consideration and the aggregate net consideration (after such aggregate net consideration is adjusted for Company expenses, purchase price adjustments, escrow amounts, purchase price holdbacks, indemnity obligations and other similar items) shall be divided ratably among the Transferring Holder and each participating Participation Member based upon their respective numbers of Shares included in the Transfer. 

(c) 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.07, the Transferring Holder(s) shall not consummate the Transfer contemplated by the Tag Notice at a higher price or on other terms and conditions more favorable to them, in the aggregate, than the terms set forth in the Tag Notice (including as to price per Class A-1 Preferred Share or form of consideration to be received) unless the Transferring Holder(s) shall first have delivered a second notice setting forth such more favorable terms (the "Amended Tag Notice") to each Participation 

(d) 
Each Participation Member shall pay his, her or its own costs of any sale and a pro rata share (based upon the reduction in proceeds that would have been allocated to such Member if the amount of such expense were not included in the aggregate consideration) of the expenses incurred by the Members (to the extent such costs are incurred for the benefit of all of such Members and are not otherwise paid by the Transferee) and the Company in connection with such Transfer and shall be obligated to provide the same customary representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, indemnities and other obligations that the Transferring Holder(s) agrees to provide in connection with such Transfer; provided, that in no event will a Participation Member be required to enter into a non-competition agreement or be subject to any similar covenant or provision. Except as contemplated by the preceding sentence, each Participation Member shall execute and deliver all documents required to be executed in connection with such tag-along sale transaction. 

(e) 
Without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Section 9.07, the Transferring Holder(s) shall decide whether or not to pursue, consummate, postpone or abandon any Transfer and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.07, the terms and conditions thereof. None of the Transferring Holder(s) nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability to any Member arising from, relating to or in connection with the pursuit, consummation, postponement, abandonment or terms and conditions of any such Transfer except to the extent the Transferring Holder(s) shall have failed to comply with any of the other provisions of this Section 9.07. 

9.08 Sale of the Company. 

(a) 
Provided that a Drag-Along Notice has not been delivered and the procedures in Section 9.09 are not then currently in effect, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of Directors may (subject to Section 5.11) elect to cause a Sale of the Company at any time. The Board of Directors shall direct and control all decisions in connection with a Sale of the Company (including the hiring or termination of any investment bank or professional adviser and making all decisions regarding valuation and consideration and the percentage of the Equity Securities in the Company to be sold) and, subject to Section 9.08(b) and Section 9.08(d), and without prejudice to Section 5.11, each Member shall vote for, consent to and not object to such Sale of the Company or the sale process associated therewith. If such Sale of the Company is structured as a sale of assets, merger or consolidation, then each Member shall, to the extent applicable to such transaction, vote for or consent to, and waive any dissenter's rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with, such sale, merger or consolidation. If such Sale of the Company is structured as a Transfer of Shares, and the Sale of the Company involves less than all of the Shares in the Company, then each Member shall Transfer the same percentage of each class or series of Shares (or rights to acquire Shares of any class or series) that it holds. Each Member and the Company shall take all reasonable and necessary actions in connection with the 


48 
49 
consummation of such Sale of the Company as may be requested by the Board of Directors, including (i) in the case of the Company only, engaging one or more investment banks and legal counsel selected by the Board of Directors to establish procedures acceptable to the Board of Directors to effect and to otherwise assist in connection with a Sale of the Company, (ii) taking such commercially reasonable actions and providing such commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance as may be necessary to consummate the Sale of the Company in an expeditious and efficient manner and not taking any action or engaging in any activity designed to hinder, prevent or delay the consummation of the Sale of the Company, (iii) in the case of the Company only, facilitating the due diligence process in respect of any such Sale of the Company, including establishing, populating and maintaining an online "data room", (iv) in the case of the Company only, providing any financial or other information or audit required by the proposed buyer's financing sources and (v) the execution of such agreements and such instruments and other actions reasonably necessary in connection with the Sale of the Company, including to provide customary representations, warranties, indemnities and escrow arrangements relating thereto, in each case in accordance with and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.08(d). 
(b) 
The obligations of the Members with respect to a Sale of the Company are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) upon the consummation of such Sale of the Company, each holder of Shares, to the extent such holder is receiving any consideration, shall receive the same form(s) of consideration as each other holder of Shares receives (or the option to receive the same form of consideration), and (ii) the Sale of the Company will be a Deemed Liquidation Event and the aggregate consideration payable upon consummation of such Sale of the Company to all holders of Shares in respect of their Shares shall be apportioned and distributed (after such aggregate consideration is adjusted for Company expenses, purchase price adjustments, escrow amounts, purchase price holdbacks, indemnity obligations and other similar items) as between the classes of Shares in accordance with the relevant provisions of Section 3.02 (assuming that, if such Sale of the Company is structured as a Transfer of Shares and less than all of the Shares are being Transferred, the Shares included in the Transfer are all of the Shares outstanding). For clarity, the application of Section 3.02 may result in some Shares included in the Transfer not receiving any consideration with respect to such Sale of the Company. 

(c) 
If the Company, or if the holders of any Shares, enter into any negotiation or transaction for which Rule 506 (or any similar rule then in effect) promulgated by the SEC may be available with respect to such negotiation or transaction (including a merger, consolidation, or other reorganization), each holder of Equity Securities will, at the request of the Company, appoint either a purchaser representative (as such term is defined in Rule 501) designated by the Company, in which event the Company will pay the fees of such purchaser representative, or another purchaser representative (reasonably acceptable to the Company), in which event such holder will be responsible for the fees of the purchaser representative so appointed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in connection with any Sale of the Company where the consideration in such Sale of the Company consists of or includes securities, if the issuance of such securities to the Member would require either a registration statement under the Securities Act, or preparation of a disclosure statement pursuant to Regulation D (or any successor regulation) under the Securities Act, or preparation of a disclosure document under a similar provision of any state securities law, and such registration statement or disclosure statement or other disclosure document is not otherwise being 

(d) 
In connection with any Sale of the Company, each Member shall (i) make such customary representations and warranties, including, as applicable, as to due organization and good standing, power and authority, due approval, no conflicts and ownership and title of Shares (including the absence of liens with respect to such Shares) and no litigation pending or threatened against or affecting such Member relating to its ownership of Shares, agree to such covenants and enter into such definitive agreements, in each case as are customary for transactions of the nature of the Sale of the Company; provided, that no Member shall be required to make any representation or warranty or agree to any covenant that is more extensive or burdensome than those made by the other Members (provided, that (A) in no event will the GM Investor or any of its Affiliates, SoftBank or any of its Affiliates or Honda or any of its Affiliates be required to enter into a non-competition agreement or be subject to any similar covenant or provision and (B) the Employee Members may be required to enter into certain covenants, including non-compete and non-solicit obligations) and (ii) be obligated to join on a several, and not joint, basis (determined in accordance with such Member's proportionate share of the proceeds from the Sale of the Company) in any indemnification or other obligations that are part of the terms and conditions of the Sale of the Company (other than to the extent of any escrows or holdbacks established in connection with such Sale of the Company); provided, that no Member shall be obligated (A) to provide indemnification with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any other Member (other than to the extent of any escrows or holdbacks established in connection with such Sale of the Company), or (B) to incur liability to any Person in connection with such Sale of the Company, including under any indemnity, in excess of the consideration received by such Person in the Sale of the Company (other than for fraud or breach of a covenant). 

(e) 
Each Member will bear his, her or its proportionate share of the costs incurred in connection with a Sale of the Company to the extent such costs are incurred for the benefit of all such holders of Shares and are not otherwise paid by the Company or the acquiring party. Costs incurred by the holders of Shares on their own behalf will not be considered costs of the Sale of the Company. 

(f) 
Any contingent consideration (whether as a result of a release of an escrow or the payment of an "earn out" or otherwise) to be paid in connection with a Sale of the Company shall be allocated among the Members such that each Member receives the amount which such Member would have received if such consideration had been received by the Company and distributed as the next incremental dollars following the Distribution of any amounts previously paid under this Agreement or paid in connection with such Sale of the Company (assuming for such purposes that the Shares Transferred constitute all of the Shares). In the event any Member is liable in such Sale of the Company for amounts in excess of any escrow or holdback (other than any such obligations that relate specifically to a particular Member, such as indemnification with respect to representations and warranties given by a Member regarding such Person's title to and ownership of Shares), such amounts shall be treated as a deduction to the consideration payable in such Sale of the Company and the aggregate consideration shall be re-allocated among the Members in accordance with Section 9.08(b). The Members agree that to the extent, as a result of such re­

(g) 
Without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Section 9.08 but subject to Section 5.11, the Board of Directors shall determine whether or not to pursue, consummate, postpone or abandon any Sale of the Company and, subject to the limitations expressly set forth in this Section 9.08, the terms and conditions thereof. 

(h) The provisions of this Section 9.08 shall not apply to any transaction pursuant to Sections 9.10 or 9.12. 
9.09 Drag-Along. 

(a) 
If the GM Investor proposes to Transfer more than fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding Equity Securities to an Independent Third Party prior to an IPO (other than any Transfer (i) as provided in Section 9.08, (ii) in connection with Section 9.10, or (iii) pursuant to Section 9.12), the GM Investor shall have the right (but not the obligation) to deliver a written notice (such notice, the "Drag-Along Notice") of its intention to do so to each other Member (the "Dragees"). The Drag-Along Notice shall set forth the aggregate consideration to be paid by the Independent Third Party and the other material terms and conditions of such transaction (a "Drag-Along Sale Transaction"), which shall be the same (in all but de minimis and immaterial respects) for the GM Investor and the other Members except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. Upon receipt of the Drag-Along Notice, each Dragee shall be required to participate in the proposed Transfer in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 9.09; provided, that if such Drag-Along Sale Transaction involves less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Shares held by the GM Investor, then each Dragee will only be required to participate in the proposed Transfer to the Independent Third Party with respect to such percentage of each class of its Shares as equals the percentage of the GM Investor's total Shares being sold in such Drag-Along Sale Transaction (the "Drag Percentage"). If the GM Investor is given an option as to the form and amount of consideration to be received under this Section 9.09, all Dragees shall be given the same option and, otherwise, the ratio of both (i) any cash to any non-cash consideration and (ii) among any type of non-cash property or asset consideration to any other type of non-cash property or asset consideration shall be equal (to the extent reasonably practicable) for each of the GM Investor and the Dragees. Within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of the Drag-Along Notice, each Dragee shall deliver to a representative of the Company or the GM Member designated in the Drag-Along Notice such certificates (if certificated) representing all Shares (or the Drag Percentage of each class of its Shares, as applicable) held by such Dragee or in other cases mutually acceptable instruments of transfer duly endorsed, together with a limited power-of-attorney authorizing the Company and the GM Investor to sell or otherwise dispose of such Shares pursuant to the proposed Transfer to the Independent Third Party, as well as any other documents required to be executed in connection with such transaction. In the event that any Dragee should fail to deliver such certificates (if certificated) or other documentation to the Company or the GM Investor's representative, the Company shall cause the books and records of the Company to show that the Shares of such Dragee 

(b) 
The Company and the GM Investor shall have ninety (90) days following delivery of the Drag-Along Notice to complete the Transfer of the Shares in accordance with this Section 9.09; provided, that if such Transfer would require the GM Investor, any Dragee, the Independent Third Party, the Company or an Affiliate of any of the foregoing to obtain any regulatory approval prior to consummating such sale, such ninety (90) day period shall be extended to the date that is five (5) Business Days after such regulatory approval has been obtained or finally denied. If, within such ninety (90) day period (as it may be extended) after the Company or the GM Investor has given the Drag-Along Notice, it shall not have completed the Transfer of all the Shares of the GM Investor and the Dragees in accordance with this Section 9.09 the Company or the GM Investor shall return to each of the Dragees all certificates (if certificated) representing Shares, or in other cases, mutually acceptable instruments of transfer, that the Dragees delivered for Transfer pursuant hereto and that were not purchased in accordance with this Section 9.09; provided, that (i) if any one or more of the Dragees defaults, the Company or the GM Investor shall be permitted, but not obligated, to complete the sale by all non-defaulting Dragees, and (ii) the completion of the sale by the Company or the GM Investor and such non-defaulting Dragees shall not relieve a defaulting Dragee of liability for its breach. All reasonable out-of­pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company, the GM Investor and the Dragees in connection with the Transfers set forth in this Section 9.09 shall be paid by the Company. 

(c) 
A Drag-Along Sale Transaction will be a Deemed Liquidation Event and the aggregate consideration payable upon consummation of such Drag-Along Sale Transaction to all holders of Shares in respect of their Shares included in such Drag-Along Sale Transaction shall be apportioned and distributed (after such aggregate consideration is adjusted for Company expenses, purchase price adjustments, escrow amounts, purchase price holdbacks, indemnity obligations and other similar items) as between the classes of Shares included in such Drag-Along Sale Transaction in accordance with the relevant provisions of Section 3.02 (it being understood that, if less than all of the Shares are being Transferred, for purposes of such calculations, it shall be assumed that the Shares included in such Drag-Along Sale Transaction constitute all of the Shares outstanding). For clarity, the application of Section 3.02 may result in some Shares included in the Drag-Along Sale Transaction not receiving any consideration with respect to such Drag-Along Sale Transaction. 

(d) 
The provisions of this Section 9.09 shall not apply to any Transfer to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with Section 9.02. 

9.10 Public Offering. 

(a) 
If the Board of Directors authorizes (subject to Section 5.11 and Section 6.13(d)) the Company to undertake an IPO (which may be abandoned at any time prior to its consummation by the Board of Directors), or the GM Investor notifies the Company that it wishes to consummate an IPO that takes the form of distribution of IPO Shares to the stockholders of GM Parent pursuant to a Form 10 (or any successor form), then each of the Company, the Members and any holder of Equity Securities agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to, take such commercially reasonable actions and provide such commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance as may 


50 
51 
52 
53 
be necessary to consummate the IPO in an expeditious and efficient manner and not to take any action or engage in any activity designed to hinder, prevent or delay the consummation of the IPO. Subject to Section 9.10(b), in connection with the IPO, each Share will be exchanged on an as-converted basis as if all Junior Interests are converted on a 1:1 basis (as adjusted, as necessary, to reflect appropriate and proportional adjustments to take into account any subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of shares or similar event) and all Class A-1 Preferred Shares are converted in accordance with Section 2.10(b), for one share or unit (as applicable) of the single type of equity security of the Company that is listed and admitted for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Market or other nationally recognized exchange (the "IPO Shares"). For purposes of this Section 9.10 and Section 9.11, all references to "Company" shall also refer to (i) any corporate successor to the Company or (ii) any parent or Subsidiary of the Company, in each case which effects the IPO. 
(b) 
The IPO Shares issued to (i) each Class A-1 Preferred Member with respect to each Class A-1 Preferred Share, each Class B Member with respect to each Class B Common Share, each Class D Member with respect to each Class D Common Share and each Class E Member with respect to each Class E Common Share and (ii) any other Investor in respect of Equity Securities issued pursuant to Section 2.06 (if such Equity Securities are designated as low-vote Equity Securities by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance or at any time thereafter) (collectively, the "Low-Vote IPO Shares") will be of a different class to each other IPO Share. The Low-Vote IPO Shares will be identical to each other IPO Share, except that they will be entitled only to the number of votes (including a fraction of a vote) per Low-Vote IPO Share on all matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote (including the election of directors) as will be reasonably determined by the GM Investor to enable the GM Investor to establish or maintain "control" (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) of the Company at the time of the consummation of the IPO (in the case of an IPO effected by a "spin-off" or "split-off" transaction), or immediately after the consummation of the IPO (in the case of any other IPO), in each case taking into account any other planned issuances or transfers of IPO Shares. Each Member, including each Class A-1 Preferred Member, will take all reasonable action requested by the Company to give effect to this Section 9.10(b) and to cause GM to have "control" within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code immediately prior to any "spin-off" or "split-off" transaction. 

(c) 
Without limiting (and without prejudice to) the other subsections of this Section 9.10, if immediately prior to an IPO the Board of Directors determines that it is in the best interests of the Company and its Members (taken as a whole) to engage in a reorganization pursuant to which a new corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other entity (the "Entity") is formed and the Equity Securities of the company are recapitalized or reorganized into classes of Equity Securities of the Entity, then each Member will (i) consent (and, to the extent required, vote in favor of) such recapitalization, reorganization or exchange of the existing Equity Securities of the Company into the Equity Securities of the Entity, and (ii) take all such reasonable actions that are necessary in connection with the consummation of the recapitalization, reorganization or exchange, including entering into a new stockholders' agreement, members' agreement, limited liability company agreement, employee equity arrangements and/or other agreements and arrangements in respect of the Equity Securities of the Entity, in each case, on terms and conditions 


54 
substantially similar to such agreements and arrangements in respect of the Equity Securities of the Company that are in effect immediately prior to such recapitalization or reorganization; provided, that the Board of Directors shall not be permitted to approve, the Company shall not be permitted to engage in, and no Member shall be required to provide any consent to or to take any action in connection with, any such formation, recapitalization or reorganization, in each case if (A) such formation, recapitalization or reorganization was undertaken in bad faith, (B) the intent or direct result of such formation, recapitalization or reorganization is or would be to impair, in any material respect, the express rights of any Member hereunder or (C) such formation, recapitalization or reorganization adversely affects any Member in a manner which is disproportionate to the other Members (except as contemplated by this Section 9.10). For the avoidance of doubt, any reorganization or recapitalization undertaken pursuant to this Section 9.10(c) shall include provision for an Equity Security analogous to the Low-Vote IPO Shares described in Section 9.10(b) above. 
9.11 Registration Rights; "Market Stand-Off" Agreement; Volume Restrictions. 
(a) 
After the consummation of an IPO pursuant to Section 9.10, the Company shall grant to (i) the GM Investor an unlimited number of demand registration rights (including underwritten offerings), (ii) each Class A-1 Preferred Member that, together with its Affiliates, beneficially owns more than ten percent (10%) of the Equity Securities in the Company, demand registration rights (including underwritten offerings) and (iii) all Members that, together with its Affiliates, beneficially own more than five percent (5%) of the Equity Securities in the Company, piggyback registration rights and shelf registration rights, in each case, subject to customary terms and conditions as at the time of the IPO; provided, that the Class A-1 Preferred Members may collectively exercise up to three (3) demands, the Company shall not be required to consummate more than one (1) demand registration (including underwritten offering) per ninety (90) day period, the Company shall not be required to consummate any demand registration (including underwritten offering) expected to realize less than $100,000,000 of gross proceeds (before deduction of any underwriting discount, fees or expenses) and the Company may suspend registration rights for up to one hundred twenty (120) days in any calendar year if the filing or maintenance of a registration statement would, if not so suspended, adversely affect a proposed corporate transaction or adversely affect the Company by requiring premature disclosure of confidential information. 

(b) 
Each Member hereby agrees that (i) during the period of duration (up to, but not exceeding, one hundred eighty (180) days) specified by the Company and an underwriter of Equity Securities of the Company or its successor, following the date of the final prospectus distributed in connection with the IPO, it shall not, to the extent requested by the Company and such underwriter, directly or indirectly sell, offer to sell, contract to sell (including any short sale or other hedging transaction), grant any option to purchase or otherwise Transfer or dispose of (other than to donees who agree to be similarly bound) any Equity Securities held by it at any time during such period except for such Equity Securities as shall be included in such registration and (ii) it shall, if requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with the IPO, execute a customary "lockup" agreement in the form requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters with a duration not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days. 

(c) 
Each Member hereby agrees that (i) during the period of duration (up to, but not exceeding, ninety (90) days) specified by the Company and an underwriter of Equity Securities of the Company or its successor, following the date of the final prospectus distributed in connection with an underwritten public follow-on offering, it shall not, to the extent requested by the Company and such underwriter, directly or indirectly sell, offer to sell, contract to sell (including any short sale or other hedging transaction), grant any option to purchase or otherwise Transfer or dispose of (other than to donees who agree to be similarly bound) any Equity Securities held by it at any time during such period except for such Equity Securities as shall be included in such registration and (ii) it shall, if requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with an underwritten public follow-on offering, execute a customary "lockup" agreement in the form requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters with a duration not to exceed ninety (90) days. 

(d) 
All Members shall be treated similarly with respect to any release prior to the termination of the time periods for the transfer restrictions contemplated by Section 9.11(b) and Section 9.11(c) (including any extension thereof) such that if any such persons are released, then all Members shall also be released to the same extent on a pro rata basis. In order to enforce the foregoing covenant in connection with the IPO or an underwritten public follow-on offering, the Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Equity Securities of each Member and its Affiliates (and the Equity Securities of every other Person subject to the foregoing restriction) until the end of such period, and each Member agrees that, if so requested, such Member will execute, and will cause its Affiliates to execute, an agreement in the form provided by the underwriter containing terms which are essentially consistent with the provisions of Section 9.11(a), Section 9.11(b) and Section 9.11(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations described in Section 9.11(a), Section 9.11(b) and Section 9.11(c) shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8 or similar forms which may be promulgated in the future, or a registration relating solely to an SEC Rule 145 transaction on Form S-4 or similar forms which may be promulgated in the future. 

9.12 GM Call Right. 

(a) 
At any time after the SoftBank Trigger Date the Company will have the right, by providing written notice to each Class A-1 Preferred Member, each Class D Member and the Board of Directors (a "SoftBank Call Notice"), to purchase from each Class A-1 Preferred Member and each Class D Member all (but not less than all) of the Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Common Shares then owned by such Members (and any other Equity Securities held by such Members) in exchange for a cash purchase price (i) per Class A-1 Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) the applicable Class A-1 Liquidation Preference Amount, and (B) the Per Class A-1 Preferred Share FMV, and (ii) per Class D Common Share (or any other Equity Securities held by such Members) equal to the Per Class A-1 Preferred Share FMV (collectively, the "Class A-1/D Purchase"). If an Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice has been delivered pursuant to Section 9.13 and, subsequent to the delivery of such Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice, a SoftBank Call Notice is delivered to a Class A-1 Preferred Member or Class D Member, then the process contemplated by Section 9.13 shall be suspended (it being understood that if the Class A-1/D Purchase is subsequently terminated or otherwise fails to be consummated, the process contemplated 

(b) 
At any time after the Honda Call Trigger Date, the Company will have the right, by providing written notice to each Class E Member and the Board of Directors (a "Honda Call Notice" and, together with the SoftBank Call Notice, a "Call Notice"), to purchase from each Class E Member all (but not less than all) of the Class E Common Shares then owned by such Members (and any other Equity Securities held by such Members) in exchange for a cash purchase price per Class E Common Share (or any other Equity Securities held by such Members) equal to the Per Class E FMV (the "Class E Purchase"). 

Delivery of a Call Notice with respect to the Class A-1 Preferred Shares, Class D Common Shares or Class E Common Shares will commence the process set forth on Exhibit II (provided, that in the event of a Honda Call Notice, (1) references to "SoftBank" and the "Majority of the Class A-1 Preferred" on Exhibit II shall be replaced with "Honda" and (2) the Qualified Appraisers will only calculate the Standardized FMV and not the IP Upsized FMV). 

(c) 
The Company and each Class A-1 Preferred Member, Class D Member and Class E Member will consummate the Class A-1/D Purchase or the Class E Purchase, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within thirty (30) days following the date of determination of the Per Class A-1 Preferred Share FMV or Per Class E FMV (as applicable). The Class A-1/D Purchase or the Class E Purchase, as applicable, shall be memorialized in a written agreement containing customary terms for a transaction of this type; provided, that no Class A-1 Preferred Member, Class D Member or Class E Member shall be required to make any representations or warranties other than representations and warranties as to due organization and good standing, power and authority, due approval, no conflicts and ownership and title of Shares (including the absence of liens with respect to such Shares), no brokers and no litigation pending or threatened against or affecting such Member relating to its ownership of Shares. 

(d) 
Each Class A-1 Preferred Member, Class D Member and Class E Member, as applicable, shall take all commercially reasonable actions and provide such other commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance as may be necessary to consummate the Class A-1/D Purchase or Class E Purchase, as applicable, in an expeditious and efficient manner and will not take any action or engage in any activity designed to hinder, prevent or delay the consummation of the Class A-1/D Purchase or Class E Purchase, as applicable. 

(e) 
At any time after the SoftBank Trigger Date or the Honda Call Trigger Date, as applicable, the GM Investor (or one of its Affiliates) may issue a Call Notice in lieu of the Company, in which event all references to the Company in this Section 9.12 (other than this Section 9.12(e)) shall be deemed to be references to the GM Investor.

9.13 Optional SoftBank Conversion. 
(a) 
If an IPO, Sale of the Company or dissolution (pursuant to Article X) has not been consummated prior to the SoftBank Trigger Date then, at any time after the SoftBank Trigger Date and subject to Section 9.12(a), SoftBank or its Permitted Transferee shall be entitled to deliver to the Board of Directors an irrevocable written notice (the "Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice") requiring the Company to, at the election of the GM Investor (i) use its reasonable best efforts to redeem all, but not less than all, of SoftBank's Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Shares for common stock of GM Parent, or (ii) redeem all, but not less than all of SoftBank's Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Shares for cash, in each case on the terms set forth herein and, in the case of sub-section (i), on the terms set forth in the Exchange Agreement. Delivery of the Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice will commence the process set forth on Exhibit II. 

(b) 
Within ten (10) Business Days of the date of determination of the final Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value pursuant to Exhibit II, the Company will deliver written notice to SoftBank, informing SoftBank of the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value and whether the GM Investor has elected to have the Company redeem SoftBank's Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Shares (i) for cash, at a per Share value equal to the applicable Optional SoftBank Conversion Share Price (the "Cash Election"), or (ii) in exchange for common stock of GM Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement in which case GM Parent and SoftBank or its Permitted Transferee will enter into the Exchange Agreement (the "Stock Election"). If, upon consummation of the Sale of GM Parent, GM Parent (it being understood that if GM has merged or consolidated into any other Person or sold all or substantially all of its assets in any one or a series of related to transactions to such other Person, GM Parent shall include such successor or other Person) is not listed or traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market or any successor exchange or market thereof, any national securities exchange (registered with the SEC under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or any other established non-U.S. exchange, then the GM Acquirer shall be required to settle any Stock Election pursuant to this Section 9.13 in cash. 

(c) 
If the Cash Election is made, the Company and SoftBank or its Permitted Transferee will consummate the redemption by the Company of the Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Shares (the "Optional SoftBank Conversion Purchase") as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days of the Cash Election. The place for closing shall be the principal office of the Company or at such other place as the Company may reasonably determine. In the event of a Cash Election, at the closing thereof SoftBank shall deliver to the Company certificates (if certificated) for its Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Shares or, in other cases, mutually acceptable instruments of transfer, in exchange for payment (per Class A-1 Preferred Share and Class D Share held by SoftBank) of the relevant Optional SoftBank Conversion Share Price. The Optional SoftBank Conversion Purchase shall be memorialized in a written agreement containing representations and warranties as to due organization and good standing, power and authority, due approval, no conflicts and ownership and title of Shares (including the absence of liens with respect to such Shares), no brokers and no litigation pending or threatened against or affecting SoftBank relating to its ownership of Shares. Each of the Company and SoftBank or its 

(d) 
If the Stock Election is made, SoftBank or its Permitted Transferee will (and the Company and the GM Investor will cause GM Parent to) promptly (and in any event within five (5) days) enter into the Exchange Agreement. 

(e) 
If the Company, acting reasonably and in good faith, determines that a filing, notice, approval, consent, registration, permit, authorization or confirmation from any Governmental Authority may be required to consummate the transactions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, then the Company and SoftBank or its Permitted Transferee shall (and SoftBank shall cause its Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate in good faith during the pendency of the calculation of the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value to seek to obtain such approvals as promptly as practicable such that in the event a Stock Election is made the period between signing the Exchange Agreement and closing the transaction thereunder would be reduced. For clarity, nothing in this Section 9.13(e) will require the Company to make a Stock Election (as opposed to a Cash Election) and the intention of this Section 9.13(e) is solely to take such actions as may reduce (in the event a Stock Election is made) the period between the execution of the Exchange Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby. 

(f) 
In lieu of a redemption of the Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Shares by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.13, the GM Investor will have the right to have such Class A-1 Preferred Shares and Class D Shares transferred to the GM Investor (or its Affiliates) and, if a Cash Election has been made, to have the GM Investor (or its Affiliates) make the applicable cash payments. 

(g) 
If an Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice has been delivered and an IPO or a Sale of the Company is pending, but has not yet been consummated, SoftBank will, and will cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with the Company and each other Member to ensure that the IPO or Sale of the Company, as applicable, is carried out in an expeditious manner and minimizing the effect (economically or otherwise) on such IPO or Sale of the Company of this Section 9.13.

the liquidator shall distribute all remaining assets of the Company by the end of the taxable year of the Company during which the liquidation of the Company occurs (or, if later, 90 days after the date of the liquidation) in accordance with Section 3.02 (but subject to the other applicable provisions in this Agreement); and 

(h) 
all distributions in kind to the Members shall be made subject to the liability of each distributee for costs, expenses and liabilities theretofore incurred or for which the Company has committed prior to the date of termination, and those costs, expenses and liabilities shall be allocated to the distributees pursuant to this Section 10.02. The distribution of cash and/or property to a Member in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.02 constitutes a complete return

(viii) General Motors Ventures LLC (and not the GM Investor or any of its Subsidiaries) from acquiring capital stock or other ownership interests, or owning or holding capital stock or other ownership interests, in the normal course of its business and investing activities, in any Person engaged in the Restricted Business;

(c) 
Waiver. The failure of any Person to insist in one or more instances on performance by another Person of any obligation, condition or other term of this Agreement in strict accordance with the provisions hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any right granted hereunder or of the future performance of any obligation, condition or other term of this Agreement in strict accordance with the provisions hereof, and no waiver with respect thereto shall be effective unless contained in a writing signed by or on behalf of the waiving party.

Each Member waives any objection based on forum non conveniens and waives any objection to venue of any action instituted hereunder. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

69 
12.12 Title to Company Assets. Company assets shall be deemed to be owned by the Company as an entity, and no Member, individually or collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such Company assets or any portion thereof. Legal title to any or all Company assets may be held in the name of the Company or one or more nominees, as the Board of Directors may determine.

All Company assets shall be recorded as the property of the Company on its books and records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Company assets is held. 
12.13 Creditors. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by any non-Member creditors of the Company or any of its Affiliates, and no non-Member creditor who makes a loan to the Company or any of its Affiliates may have or acquire (except pursuant to the terms of a separate agreement executed by the Company in favor of such creditor) at any time as a result of making the loan any direct or indirect interest in Distributions, capital or property or the rights of the Board of Directors to require Capital Contributions other than as a secured creditor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Member who is, or whose Affiliates are, a creditor or lender of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including a trade creditor pursuant to any Commercial Agreement) shall be entitled to exercise all of its rights as a creditor of lender of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as set forth in the applicable credit document or other agreement between such Member (or its Affiliates) and the Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise available to such Member (or its Affiliates) in such capacity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any such Member (or its Affiliates), in exercising its rights as a creditor or lender, will have no duty to consider (i) its or its Affiliates' status as a direct or indirect equity owner of the Company or its Subsidiaries, 
(ii) the interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) any duty it or any of its Affiliates may have hereunder or otherwise to any other Member, except as may be required under the applicable credit or other documents or by commercial law applicable to creditors generally. 
12.14 Remedies. The Company and the Members shall be entitled to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement specifically, to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement (including costs of enforcement) and to exercise any and all other rights at law or at equity existing in their respective favor. The Company and each Assignee and Member further agrees and acknowledges that money damages shall not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement (and thus waive as defense that there is an adequate remedy at law), and that, accordingly, the Company or any Member shall, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, be entitled (without posting a bond or other security) to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain threatened breaches of, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations under this Agreement. The Company and each Member and Assignee hereby waives any right to claim that specific performance should not be ordered to prevent or remedy a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, and agrees not to raise any objections on the basis that a remedy at laws would be adequate or on any other basis, (a) to the availability or appropriateness of the equitable remedy of specific performance, or (b) to the rights of the Company and the Members to specifically enforce 
70 
12.15 Time is of the Essence; Computation of Time. Time is of the essence for each and every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge of any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day other than a Business Day, the party having such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day. 
12.16 Notice to Members of Provisions. By executing this Agreement, each Member acknowledges that it has actual notice of (i) all of the provisions hereof (including the restrictions on transfer set forth in Article IX) and (ii) all of the provisions of the Certificate of Formation. 
12.17 Further Assurances. In connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, each Member shall execute and deliver any additional documents and instruments and perform any additional acts that may be necessary to effectuate and perform the provisions of this Agreement and those transactions. 
12.18 Termination.

Exh. I-1 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Joinder as of the date first above written. 
Exh. I-2 
The Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value of the Company will be the total value, in dollars, of the consideration that would be received by the Members in a sale of one hundred percent (100%) of the Shares (on a Fully Diluted Basis), calculated in accordance with the process, and consistent with the methodologies, set forth below. The calculation of Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value will consist of two independent valuations, the Standardized FMV and the IP Upsized FMV each calculated, contemporaneously (using the same Qualified Appraisers), in accordance with the process below. 
Process 
(a) 
One Qualified Appraiser shall be selected by the GM Investor and the other Qualified Appraiser shall be selected by the Majority of the Class A-1 Preferred (such Members, the "Applicable FMV Parties"). 

(b) 
Each of the Qualified Appraisers so selected by the Applicable FMV Parties must be engaged by the Applicable FMV Parties within fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Call Notice or Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice (as applicable) and the Board of Directors shall, within one (1) Business Day of delivery of the Call Notice or Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice (as applicable), notify each of the Applicable FMV Parties of such event. 

(c) 
Each Qualified Appraiser shall be (i) required to determine the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value within forty-five (45) days after being notified of its selection, (ii) provided with the same access to the management of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the same source documents, books and records (including financial and operating data) and information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries and (iii) required to determine a single point estimate of Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value and not a range of values. 

(d) 
Following each Qualified Appraiser's determination of Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value (which determination shall be provided to each Applicable FMV Party together with a customary valuation report setting forth in reasonable detail such Qualified Appraiser's calculation of Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value prepared consistently with the methodologies set forth below), (i) if the lower of the two determinations by the two Qualified Appraisers is within ten percent (10%) of the higher of the determinations, then the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value shall be the average of the two determinations, and will be final and binding on the relevant parties or (ii) if the lower of the two determinations is not within ten percent (10%) of the higher of the determinations, then (A) the Applicable FMV Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as to which the Applicable FMV Parties may mutually agree) to agree upon the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value, any such agreement to be made by each Applicable FMV Party and to be set forth in writing signed by each of the Applicable FMV Parties (and any such agreement will be final and binding on the relevant 


Exh. II-1 
parties), and (B) if no such agreement is reached by the Applicable FMV Parties within such thirty (30)-day time period, then a third Qualified Appraiser (acting as expert and not arbitrator) that is selected (within fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the thirty (30)-day time period for good faith negotiations) by mutual agreement of the original two Qualified Appraisers will determine its own valuation of the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value in accordance with the methodologies set forth below within forty-five (45) days following its appointment and the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value will be the average of (1) such third Qualified Appraiser's determination of the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value and (2) the valuation of the original Qualified Appraiser that is numerically closest to the third Qualified Appraiser's valuation. 
(e) 
The third Qualified Appraiser shall have the same access to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their employees and officers and the source documents, books and records (including financial and operating data) and information as the original Qualified Appraisers. 

(f) 
Each Applicable FMV Party will bear the cost of the Qualified Appraiser selected by it and one-half of the cost of any third Qualified Appraiser that may be required in accordance with the preceding sentence (and, if an Applicable FMV Party consists of more than one Member, then such costs will be shared equally by such Members). 


Methodologies 
In calculating Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value, each Qualified Appraiser will utilize customary valuation methodologies in their respective professional judgments, subject to such instructions mutually agreed by the Applicable FMV Parties within ten (10) days following the selection of the initial Qualified Appraisers, which shall include at a minimum the following: 
(a) 
The Qualified Appraisers shall take into consideration the Company's and its Subsidiaries' historic financial and operating results, current balance sheet, future business prospects and projected financial and operating results, public market and industry conditions, prior financing transactions and the valuation of the Company as of such transaction (if the same is considered relevant, and requested, by the Qualified Appraisers), the valuation and performance of comparable companies and such other factors as they may determine relevant to such determination, in each case as existing as of the date the appraisal process was initiated; 

(b) 
The future business prospects and projected financial and operating results of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to the Qualified Appraisers shall (i) be prepared by the Company's management in good faith based on assumptions consistent with those used in the Company's ordinary course forecasting, (ii) if the projected financial and operating results of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to the Qualified Appraisers cover a period of ten (10) years or less, and the Qualified Appraisers so request, be extended (in the case of the projected financial and operating results) for reasonable period exceeding ten (10) years, and (iii) take into account, consistent with the Company's ordinary course forecasting and subject to the restrictions in Article XI (except as otherwise expressly stated in this Exhibit II in connection with the IP Upsizing), the scope of the intellectual property portfolio of the Company and its Subsidiaries. SoftBank will 

(c) 
The Qualified Appraisers shall value the Company as a going concern, including taking into consideration the remainder of the term, if any, of the Commercial Agreements and any agreements that the Commercial Agreements require to be put into place upon termination or amendment of the Commercial Agreements; 

(d) The Qualified Appraisers shall assume an arms-length sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller; 

(e) 
Except as otherwise contemplated by section (a) under "Methodologies," the Qualified Appraisers shall disregard any prior appraisals or valuations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including any such appraisals or valuations conducted for the purpose of valuing any rights associated with or tied or indexed to the value of the Shares of the Company or its Subsidiaries; 

(f) 
The Qualified Appraisers shall value the Company as at the date of delivery of the Call Notice or Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice (as applicable); and 

(g) 
The Qualified Appraisers shall take into account only such tax depreciation and amortization as would be allowable to the Company in respect of the Company's assets immediately prior to such deemed sale. 


Exh. II-2 
The Qualified Appraisers shall contemporaneously calculate two valuations: (A) a valuation based on the Commercial Agreements as in force at the time (the "Standardized FMV"), and (B) a valuation (the "IP Upsized FMV") as if the Transferred Assets (as defined in the IPMA) had been assigned, transferred, conveyed, and delivered to the Company (pursuant to Section 2.2 of the IPMA) immediately prior to the calculation of Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value and Section 11.01 does not apply (the "IP Upsizing"). The Standardized FMV and the IP Upsized FMV shall be identical other than the value attributable to the IP Upsizing. 
For purposes of the definition of Optional SoftBank Conversion Share Price, if the Standardized FMV is less than the Class A-1 Liquidation Preference Amount, then the Call Notice/Optional SoftBank Conversion Notice Fair Market Value will equal the IP Upsized FMV; provided, that, following the application of the IP Upsized FMV, in no event will, with respect to each Class A-1-A Preferred Share and Class A-1-B Preferred Share, the Optional SoftBank Conversion Share Price be greater than the applicable Class A-1 Liquidation Preference Amount.
